YAKE:
unsupervised keyword extraction method
statistical text features
single document
supervised methods that use machine learning algorithms are the standard
	-> long training
	-> large manually annotated data sets
domain and language independent
algorithm:
	pun poza cu pseudocodul
	-> splitting text into sentences, splitting sentences into chunks delimited
		by punctuation, splitting chunks into tokens, removing stopwords,
		tagging tokens with: d (digit or number), u (unparsable content),
		a (acronyms), u (uppercase), p (parsable content)
	   
	-> feature extraction


keyword extraction:
- document-oriented approaches -> "corpora that change,
	such as collections of published technical abstracts that grow over time" [8]
- unsupervised methods:
	-> the standard is TF-IDF (evaluates how relevant a word is in a document
	   by comparing its frequency in that doc to its freq in a large collection of docs
	-> RAKE - keyword candidates are groups of words separated by punctuation marks or
	   by stop words; a co-occurence matrix is computed; the score for each possible
	   keyword is calculated as the sum of its component words; the score of a word is:
	   degree (number of different words that co-occur with it in potential keywords)
	   / frequency [8]
