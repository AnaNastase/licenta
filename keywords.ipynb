In such an e-infrastructure environment, the scheduling of user-defined tasks is always considered as a complicated part of the overall system modelling. Specifically, in the case of inter-clouds and inter-enterprises scheduling optimization is fundamentally important for achieving the best possible capacity in terms of resource utilization. Thus, existing approaches that consider system dynamics, interoperability and heterogeneity issues become important aspects for providing advanced scheduling decisions.

       " behavior in its current state and implementation.<br>Web services have become one of the easiest ways to fulfill a wide range of tasks in multiple domains of work. Their availability has increased significantly through Service-Oriented Distributed Environments that have become standard platforms for their deployment. At the same time, the clients impose their own constraints and expectations from services and require from the service providers the best replica to satisfy these constraints. The main objective of this paper is implementing a model that can effectively and accurately determine the best endpoint of a web service deployed in a distributed environment depending on the constraints of the client that invoked it and the capabilities of each replica. While each service offers different functions and each client may have different preferences for these functions, our method is independent from the services' features and computes the best replica using properties that define quality (processing time), business constraints (service price) and client's feedback (reputation), properties available for every service. The model is purely mathematical and will produce the same results for the same values of these criteria regardless of the particular functionality of the service invoked. The algorithm behind the model also takes into account the properties specific to distributed environments such as the client's location or the load limitations of the system on which the replica is deployed. This paper describes this algorithm, along with its architecture of the system that implements the model and the tests conducted.<br>Prediction represents an important component of resource management, providing information about the future state, utilization and availability of resources.

Nowadays, cloud-based solutions can support collaborative data science platforms and deliver all types of processing operations through the network service chain. In this article we deal with healthcare-related data management and exchange, and we propose security and privacy requirements together with a novel microservices approach. We investigate how cloud computing can be adopted within healthcare systems. The interoperability of existing technologies will improve the quality of life and the efficiency of healthcare systems by making them more personalized and centered on patients, together with reducing operational costs and medical errors. To have a socially acceptable health network service chain, the security and privacy issues need to be analyzed and addressed. We explore the the security and privacy requirements and implications, and also discuss existing methods, and in the end propose an architecture of a secure manager for cloud-based healthcare-related data management and exchange.<br>This article presents of the optimization of Grid scheduling problem.

By facilitating an opportunistic environment, it aims to consistently realise a scalable resource provisioning setting that handles sudden variation in user demands. Herein we propose an architectural strategy for scheduling jobs in inter-enterprises with a particular focus to inter-clouds. The scheduling concept is based on the meta-computing paradigm, with the purpose of establishing a wide and decentralized policy control among various resources and resource owners. To this extend, we start with presenting an analysis of the cloud characteristics and inter-cloud requirements. Following this, we present an identification of the most critical issues when developing the strategy based on the functional requirements analysis.

It is therefore interesting to study different replication techniques for dynamic files in the context of a peer-group.

Although entropy for local use can be easily obtained from various hardware sources, it does not always suffice, either in terms of quantity or quality. In this paper we explore the benefits of obtaining entropy using a distributed system. The rate at which entropy data is produced can be improved by generating it in parallel on multiple sites. Additionally, because the bits of entropy come from multiple and possibly heterogeneous sources, the quality of the entropy can also be improved.

There are plenty of Cloud storage providers offering multiple options so, it is crucial to select the best solution in terms of cost and quality of service that meet customers requirements. Due to its multi-objective nature, the process of optimal service selection becomes a difficult problem.

Some of those requirements came from the fact that the robots are involved in highly dynamic environments and have to execute complex decision algorithms in real-time, while other requirements ask for batch processing of big data compatible datasets. In this paper, we propose a cloud architecture for optimizing data processing using a cloud-edge infrastructure. Besides the computational architecture, we develop a mathematical model for each type of entity in our proposal and a formal description of a data capsule, which represents a generic and flexible representation for unstructured units of data in time series databases. The architecture includes multiple processing platforms. We evaluate the proposed model in edge-cloud computing platforms designed for robots that run machine learning tasks.<br>\n",

The papers included in the proceedings present novel ideas or state-of-the-art perspectives regarding the topics of interest of the conference.<br>Modern computer based systems are characterized by several complexity dimensions: a non-exhaustive list includes scale, architecture, distribution, variability, flexibility, dynamics, workloads, time constraints, dependability, availability, security, performances. The design, implementation, operation, maintenance and evolution of such systems require informed decisions, that must be founded onto techniques and tools enabling an anticipated knowledge about the behavior of every subsystem, including hardware, software and interactions, and the whole system, and the relationship of the system and the external world, considering workloads, communication, sensing of physical interactions. Performance prediction, and in general behavior prediction, may exploit simulation based approaches or analytical techniques to evaluate in advance the effects of design choices, or variability under different workloads, or emerging behavior, of systems, and provide a valuable support in all the phases of the lifecycle of a system by means of proper modeling approaches. In this Special Issue we present some contributions that offer a glance on modeling and evaluation of complex computer based system, and that have been chosen in order to provide a view on different domains and different approaches, mainly focusing on simulation techniques and related applications.

From wired to wireless networks, exchanged packets can be lost due to routing anomalies or temporary malfunctioning at the networking hardware or software. The experienced loss pattern can be exacerbated by severe weather conditions in wireless environments and/or due to effects of a disaster. Proper recovery schemes must be put in place in order to provide loss tolerance and move a step forward realizing disaster-resilient networks. This work contributes to such an objective by proposing a loss-tolerant scheme based on forward error correction and properly implementing it in a distributed manner, by having multiple nodes generating coded information to be used for the reconstruction of the lost data without retransmissions. The problem of placing and tuning such coding nodes within a communication infrastructure has been tackled according to a repeated game theory formulation, and a preliminary evaluation demonstrates the achievable improvements in the delivery success rate with limited costs.<br>This paper presents a new iterative \n",

On the other hand, even after finding useful documents, it is hard to keep track of them as the amount of useful findings (bookmarks) increases. Also, one has to manually bookmark each time a page is even remotely interesting in order to make it easier to return to that page. In this paper we formulate a new approach to tackling these issues through a model that takes into account not just a single user's experience and intentions, but those of an entire group of users as well. We propose an application in the shape of a browser plugin/extension powered by a dedicated and highly responsive web server that can help the user keep track of his web experience in a highly organized and easy to navigate fashion while also enabling the user to share some of that experience.

The monitoring solution is a key for modeling and performance analysis of Grid systems considered as a networking and collaborative systems. The monitoring solution constantly checks the system evolution in order to facilitate performance tuning and improvement. The novelty of the work presented in this chapter is the improvement of distributed application obtained using the real-time information to compute estimates of runtime which are used to improve scheduling. Monitoring is accomplished at application level, by monitoring each job from each workflow and at system level, by aggregating state information from each processing node. The scheduling performance in distributed systems can be improved through better runtime estimation and the error detection can automatically detect several types of errors.<br>This paper presents the design, implementation and testing of the monitoring solution created for integration with a workflow execution platform.

We argue that the process of collaborative learning emerges through multiple practices such as negotiating knowledge (processes of settling specialized information based on a configuration of social statuses), negotiating knowing (processes of settling social statuses based on a distribution of specialized information) and acceding to a common learning experience.

Evolutionary algorithms are by their nature very good candidates for parallelization, and genetic algorithms do not make an exception. Moreover, researchers have stated that genetic algorithms with larger populations tend to obtain better solutions with faster convergence. These are the main reasons why they can benefit from a MapReduce implementation.

However, considering the security problems that can occur using the underlying technologies, it is difficult to construct an impenetrable system. This chapter presents e-Vote, a distributed electronic voting system architecture that is designed to ensure the accuracy, privacy, verifiability, convenience, and the openness of the democracy of a large-scale electoral process. We describe the necessary requirements for the e-voting protocol, and propose a cryptographic voting scheme that achieves them. The e-voting protocol makes use of several well-established cryptographic primitives e.g. symmetric and asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, blind signatures and secret sharing. Using the suggested framework, we also demonstrate an approach using the current computing and network technologies to effectively describe an architecture that can support a computationally secure and reliable voting process. &lt;/jats:p&gt;<br>&lt;\n",

Fractal theory and special mathematical functions are used not only for the design of nanostructures but also for studying propagation in complex artificial networks. Differential geometry is adapted for solving nonlinear partial differential equations with great number of variables for modelling propagation and transitions for different type of electromagnetic, acoustic, and optic waves. Commutative and/or additive consequences of quantum physics are used extensively in the design of long range transmission systems. Advanced mathematical tools connected to wavelets are recommended for biological phenomena. All these advanced engineering subjects require efficient mathematical models adapted for nonlinear propagation phenomena and for complex systems, when specific limitations are involved (very long distance propagation, fractal aspects and transitions in nanostructures, complex systems with great number of variables, and infinite spatiotemporal extension of material media). Using advanced mathematical tools for modeling propagation and transition phenomena, this special issue presents high qualitative and innovative developments for efficient mathematical approaches of propagation phenomena and transitions in complex systems.

It comes with features such as automatic scaling, service discovery, load balancing, fault tolerance, etc. Being such a complex system, which has a lot of internal services and with the ability to manage a lot more user services, Kubernetes comes with a monitoring system, which provides metrics and logs for every service in the cluster. However, most of the time, the monitoring system needs human intervention for detection and troubleshooting defects. Human intervention usually occurs when it is too late, when a defect appears. We think that detecting anomalies in metrics provided by the monitoring system will help to prevent defects. In this paper, we analyze current solutions for automatic anomaly detection and alerting, and also we propose a new solution that will help system administrators to catch and predict anomalies earlier, which may lead to defects.

       " of 'normal PCs and/or embedded devices, we propose a solution for the problem of efficient allocation of execution and storage resources. We distinguish between the node-level problem of scheduling the execution of object methods and the system-level problem of optimally placing objects on nodes such that locality is maximised: inter-communicating objects are kept as close to each other as possible and the most 'active' objects are hosted on nodes with the highest processing capacity and/or the highest amount of memory available. DOORS aims for architectural simplicity and achieves this by providing more control to the solution implementer, such that the behaviour of the object balancer can be tailored to the specifics of the problem addressed by the implementation. The proposed design for the balancer provides a simple relocation service, and a set of perpetually updated set of metrics, such that the solution implementer may define, 'plug in' and enforce a balancing policy out of an unlimited number of alternatives.<br>Title: Data science and big data analytics in smart environments/editors, \n",

The experienced loss pattern can be exacerbated by severe weather conditions in wireless environments and/or due to effects of a disaster. Proper recovery schemes must be put in place in order to provide loss tolerance and move a step forward realizing disaster-resilient networks. This work contributes to such an objective by proposing a loss-tolerant scheme based on forward error correction and properly implementing it in a distributed manner, by having multiple nodes generating coded information to be used for the reconstruction of the lost data without retransmissions.

For example, data like blood pressure or body temperature can be recorded and measured. The efficiency is improved by adding sensors to collect data and send it through the proposed model. The model integrates an encryption module and a machine learning module because the goal is to gather data, encrypt it to ensure privacy and train the algorithm to provide the following result: for each patient, based on their symptomatology, the algorithm will automatically analyze each variable, provide a treatment plan and predict if the health condition of a patient is getting worse.

The proposed model is a system with integrated modules for fingerprint and face recognition to certify that a driver has the right to access the vehicle. The aim is to develop a security system for intelligent vehicles that can be also a secure keyless entry system using the power of biometrics. When a driver approaches the car, a sensor will activate the recognition modules.

       " 2<br>&lt;jats:title&gt;Abstract&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;Facial Expression recognition is a computer vision problem that took relevant benefit from the research in deep learning. Recent deep neural networks achieved superior results, demonstrating the feasibility of recognizing the expression of a user from a single picture or a video recording the face dynamics. Research studies reveal that the most discriminating portions of the face surfaces that contribute to the recognition of facial expressions are located on the mouth and the eyes. The restrictions for COVID pandemic reasons have also revealed that state-of-the-art solutions for the analysis of the face can severely fail due to the occlusions of using the facial masks. This study explores to what extend expression recognition can deal with occluded faces in presence of masks. To a fairer comparison, the analysis is performed in different occluded scenarios to effectively assess if the facial masks can really imply a decrease in the recognition accuracy.

Examples of such big data sources could be airplane sensor monitoring to predict future engine crashes and avoid disaster (big data analytics) or a big data platform for modern healthcare. In the context of big data processing challenges, the in-memory computing paradigm has emerged and it is currently used by several big data platforms for data storage/query (in-memory data grids or databases) and for data processing (in-memory computing grids).<br>[Title page iii] | IEEE Conference Publication | IEEE Xplore Skip to Main Content [Title page iii] Abstract: Presents the title page of the proceedings record.

Numerical experiments are included to confirm its performance gain.<br>In distributed systems such as mobile networks, problems like heterogeneity and real-time reliable responses represent constant challenges. Furthermore, reliable identification of the participants in mobile networks is a challenging research problem because of the susceptibility to security attacks. Also, reliable identification of participants means to be able to distinguish between the device and its user. In this paper, a multi-layer mechanism is proposed for reliable identification of devices and their users in mobile networks, based on the smartphone sensor data. The proposed model can uniquely identify both the device and the users by leveraging a mobile application that harvests mobile sensor data in various usage scenarios and analyse different usage patterns. Moreover, in order to achieve data confidentiality, a cryptographic scheme is integrated, based on the public key exchange mechanism. The obtained results show that the model proposed in this paper provides meaningful insights about user behavioral patterns, without special permissions and without disclosing the actual owner identity or biometric data.<br>\n",

However, with the increasing amount of sensitive information stored on these devices, trust has become a crucial factor in mobile security. Fingerprinting, which utilizes sensors embedded in mobile devices to recognize the unique characteristics of the user, has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing trust in mobile devices. Rapid response capability is crucial for the structure of a Peer-to-Peer system, as the nodes within the network have the flexibility to enter or exit at any moment without prior notification.

It is designed as an agents platform for grid \u001b[1m\u001b[31mscheduling\u001b[0m algorithms, which denote the decentralized architecture of this model. The platform contains two type of agents: one for resource management (broker), and the other manages the users tasks requests (agents).

It is presented the description of the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mscheduling\u001b[0m algorithm in a logical flow of activities.

      "Internet of Things (IoT) represents a new paradigm in computing in which devices are connected to the internet and directly communicate with each other. Because these devices are generally thought to be wireless, small and cheap, in other words not very reliable, it is vital that we address the robustness problems in IoT. Applying standard fault tolerance models in IoT is impossible. The devices are not only heterogeneous, but unlike compute nodes, different devices have completely different capabilities and serve completely different functions (they have different sensors). We propose a model in which we describe the capabilities of each device and use this information to dynamically replace faulty devices with other, not-directly-compatible ones. Furthermore, our model uses the overlap between device characteristics in order to temporarily disable part of them and preserve energy. We show how the model can …\n",

      "Web services have become one of the easiest ways to fulfill a wide range of tasks in multiple domains of work. Their availability has increased significantly through Service-Oriented Distributed Environments that have become standard platforms for their deployment. At the same time, the clients impose their own constraints and expectations from services and require from the service providers the best replica to satisfy these constraints. The main objective of this paper is implementing a model that can effectively and accurately determine the best endpoint of a web service deployed in a distributed environment depending on the constraints of the client that invoked it and the capabilities of each replica. While each service offers different functions and each client may have different preferences for these functions, our method is independent from the services' features and computes the best replica using properties that define quality (processing time), business constraints (service price) and client's feedback (reputation), properties available for every service. The model is purely mathematical and will produce the same results for the same values of these criteria regardless of the particular functionality of the service invoked. The algorithm behind the model also takes into account the properties specific to distributed environments such as the client's location or the load limitations of the \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m on which the replica is deployed.

Initially, the objective of such techniques was to ensure availability of immutable information (typically files) in P2P \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0ms under highly dynamic nature of large P2P \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0ms. But also dynamic documents, which are documents that change over time, can be replicated. In this case, consistency issues must be addressed.

In this paper, we propose a replication \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m for documents structured as XML files and evaluate them under different scenarios.

The vision of edge computing considers that tasks are not exclusively allocated on centralized cloud platforms, but are distributed toward the edge of the network (as in the Internet of Things and fog computing paradigms), and transferred closer to the business thanks to content delivery networks. The traditional gateway becomes a set-top box machine, with additional computation and storage capabilities, where micro-tasks can be offloaded first, instead of directly to the cloud. Mobile edge computing can also be a more suitable approach to also extract knowledge from privacy sensitive \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m, which are not to be transferred to third party entities (global cloud operators) for processing.

In the current literature, reliable multicast is always achieved at the expenses of violations of temporal constraints, since retransmissions are used to recover lost messages. In this paper, we present a solution to apply a proper coding scheme so as to jointly achieve reliability and timeliness when multicasting over the Internet. Such a solution employs game theory so as to select the best locations within the multicast tree where to perform coding operations. Our driving idea is to take a distributed strategic learning in order to determine such locations without a formal characterization of the payoff functions within the non-cooperative game. We prove the quality of this solution by using a series of simulations run on OMNET++.\n",

In this paper we present a novel approach on collecting relevant \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m about IoT attacks. We detail a SSH/Telnet honeypot \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m that leverages reinforcement learning algorithms in order to interact with the attackers, and we present the results obtained in view of defining optimal reward functions to be used. One of the key issues regarding the performance of such algorithms is the direct dependence on the reward functions used. The main outcome of our study is a full implementation of an IoT honeypot \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m that leverages Apprenticeship Learning using Inverse Reinforcement Learning, in order to generate best suited reward functions.\n",

Resilience is a strongly demanding nonfunctional requirement for current computer networks, and one of the key factors to provide it is represented by loss tolerance. From wired to wireless networks, exchanged packets can be lost due to routing anomalies or temporary malfunctioning at the networking hardware or software. The experienced loss pattern can be exacerbated by severe weather conditions in wireless environments and/or due to effects of a disaster. Proper recovery schemes must be put in place in order to provide loss tolerance and move a step forward realizing disaster-resilient networks. This work contributes to such an objective by proposing a loss-tolerant scheme based on forward error correction and properly implementing it in a distributed manner, by having multiple nodes generating coded information to be used for the reconstruction of the lost \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m without retransmissions.

The evaluation process is realized by comparing source code in the abstract syntax trees (AST) representation. Detecting similarity between programs involves finding the maximum sub-graph that can be matched in both trees. The AST is a relational structure that provides a better understanding of the code. We may easily reduce this challenge to the well known tree matching problem, which has been proved to be NP-complete, as there is no deterministic algorithm able to compute the maximum match between two trees. In consequence, we developed several algorithms based on structural analysis of the abstract syntax trees and certain heuristics which are going to be explained in the following sections of the article.

Monitoring is accomplished at application level, by monitoring each job from each workflow and at \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m level, by aggregating state information from each processing node. The solution also computes aggregated statistics that allow an improvement to the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mscheduling\u001b[0m component of the \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m, with which it will interact.

The TRAVEE \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m relies on innovative concepts for improving the rehabilitation process and increasing the patient recovery rate.

Most of the innovation in recent work was proposed for the update stage, while the representation stage was routinely done with Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), due to its low complexity. We investigate here the use of other greedy sparse representation algorithms, more computationally demanding than OMP but still with convenient complexity. These algorithms include a new proposal, the projection-based Orthogonal Least Squares. It turns out that the effect of using better representation algorithms may be more significant than improving the update stage, sometimes even leveling the performance of different update algorithms.

      "Genetic Algorithms (GA) are a subclass of evolutionary algorithms that use the principle of evolution in order to search for solutions to optimization problems. Evolutionary algorithms are by their nature very good candidates for parallelization, and genetic algorithms do not make an exception. Moreover, researchers have stated that genetic algorithms with larger populations tend to obtain better solutions with faster convergence. These are the main reasons why they can benefit from a MapReduce implementation. However, research in this area is still young, and there are only a few approaches for adapting genetic algorithms to the MapReduce model. In this article we analyze the use of subpopulations for the GA MapReduce implementations.

The resource heterogeneity, the size and number of tasks, the variety of policies, and the high number of constraints are some of the main characteristics that contribute to this complexity. The necessity of \u001b[1m\u001b[31mscheduling\u001b[0m in grid is sustained by the increasing of number of users and \u001b[1m\u001b[31mapplications\u001b[0m.

A very diffiult problem that needs to be addressed is the management of the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mCloud\u001b[0m. When designing a \u001b[1m\u001b[31mCloud\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[31mscheduling\u001b[0m strategy, the design trade-offs of the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mCloud\u001b[0m architecture should be evaluated. The easiest way to evaluate this infrastructure is to use a simulation tool (in this case \u001b[1m\u001b[31mCloud\u001b[0mSim simulation toolkit). This article examines three different algorithms that consider the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mscheduling\u001b[0m of tasks in \u001b[1m\u001b[31mCloud\u001b[0m, which are described as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) (interdependent tasks). The results of the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mscheduling\u001b[0m algorithms are valuable because they are helpful for the design of the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mCloud\u001b[0m Computing \u001b[1m\u001b[31mscheduling\u001b[0m algorithms and for the design of a Service Level Agreement (SLA) contract whose members are the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mCloud\u001b[0m Service Provider (CSP) and the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mCloud\u001b[0m Service Customers (CSCs).

      "Virtual Machine (VM) replication is used primarily for achieving fault tolerance and load balancing of requests. We tackle the virtual machine replication problem (VMR) for \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m centers and take into account reducing the total power consumption. Each VM will be replicated R times on different physical machines (PMs). As such, in case of a server failure, there will be at least another PM that has the requested VM. Solving the VMR problem is equivalent to minimum cost flow problem, that can be solved optimally. After replication of VMs, we turn off the inactive PMs in order to reduce the power consumption even more. We simulate different \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m center scenarios and analyse how many inactive PMs we have achieved.\n",

However, an analysis based on circuit equations is often more effective.

      "To meet the various requirements of cloud computing users, research on guaranteeing Quality of Service (QoS) is gaining widespread attention in the field of cloud computing. However, as cloud computing platforms adopt virtualization as an enabling technology, it becomes challenging to distribute \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m resources to each user according to the diverse requirements. Although ample research has been conducted in order to meet QoS requirements, the proposed solutions lack simultaneous support for multiple policies, degrade the aggregated throughput of network resources, and incur CPU overhead. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism, called ANCS (Advanced Network Credit Scheduler), to guarantee QoS through dynamic allocation of network resources in virtualization. To meet the various network demands of cloud users, ANCS aims to concurrently provide multiple performance policies; these include weight-based proportional sharing, minimum bandwidth reservation, and maximum bandwidth limitation. In addition, ANCS develops an efficient work-conserving \u001b[1m\u001b[31mscheduling\u001b[0m method for maximizing network resource utilization. Finally, ANCS can achieve low CPU overhead via its lightweight design, which is important for practical deployment.\n",

Due to the subjectivity of expression and emotion realisation in speech, humans cannot objectively determine if one \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m is more expressive than the other. Most of the text-to-speech \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0ms have a rather flat intonation and do not provide the option of changing the output speech. We therefore present an interactive intonation optimisation method based on the pitch contour parameterisation and evolution strategies. The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is applied to the phrase level pitch contour. Then, the genome is encoded as a vector that contains 7 most significant DCT coefficients. Based on this initial individual, new speech samples are obtained using an interactive Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm. We evaluate a series of parameters involved in the process, such as the initial standard deviation, population size, the dynamic expansion of the pitch over the generations and the naturalness and expressivity of the resulted individuals. The results have been evaluated on a Romanian parametric-based speech synthesiser and provide the guidelines for the setup of an interactive optimisation \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m, in which the users can subjectively select the individual which best suits their expectations with minimum amount of fatigue. ?? 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",

Natural language is one of the the easiest ways for a user to express what he expects regarding a service.

We solve the first problem by using semantic concepts associated with the services and we define a conceptual distance to measure the similarity between the user request and a service configuration.

      "The principle underlying the temperature optimizing \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m in the plants roots area is that the temperature gradient between the soil surface and a certain depth is maintaining approximately constant throughout the year. In other words, the temperature of the soil at a certain depth is higher than the temperature of the soil surface during the cold season and lower than that in the hot season. Within the context of current climate change, this temperature difference became significant, reaching and even exceeding 10 degrees C. Due to the cooling effect of the root area during the summer is maintained, soil moisture and evaporation rate is reduced. This paper presents the results of the research carried out by INMA Bucharest as a result of the realization and experimentation of a roots cooling \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m, which was located inside a solar. The roots cooling \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m consisted of a network of closed-loop copper pipes, through which water is circulated with a circulation pump. The pipe network is arranged on two levels, the first level is 2 m deep and the other one in the root zone at a depth of 0.2 m. The water filling of the installation is done once and then only necessary to fill in case of possible loss. The effect of cooling the root crop area on hot summer days was studied on a tomato crop, set up on an experimental plot and compared in terms of evolution over time and yield obtained with a control plot placed in the immediate vicinity. Conclusions from experimental research have highlighted the fact that cooling of the root area during the warm season reduces the thermal stress to which plants are subjected and significant crop yields can be obtained.\n",
      "This paper presents an analysis of the current harmonic distortion at the point of common coupling of an office building. At first the problem of the harmonic distortion of the current wave-shape is analysed for lighting \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0ms and office equipments. Measurements are presented for each type of office load, with the purpose of emphasising the non-linear load characteristics. Next the problem of assessing the current harmonic distortion at the point of common coupling is analysed. A case study is presented, where the harmonic distortion of the current wave-shape is analysed for an office building, based on individual equipment measurements and 24-hour load operation profile. Two scenarios are discussed: with and without the implement of occupancy sensors in office rooms. It can be seen in both scenarios that the harmonic current distortions closely correlate with the fundamental current (power demand) of the office load. The use of occupancy sensors brings important energy savings, with the cost of slightly higher current harmonic distortion.\n",

We have evaluated the relationship between IMT and ACS in a group of patients with degenerative aortic stenosis. Methods: Our study cohort consisted of 196 consecutive Caucasian patients, aged 56-94, with degenerative aortic stenosis, who were free of clinic ischemic heart disease. Patients underwent standardized clinical, echocardiographic, carotid artery ultrasound and laboratory evaluation and the incidence of ACS was ascertained using validated methods. Results: During a median follow up of 3 years, 54 ACS's occurred (27.6\\%) and IMT was documented in 47 patients (87\\%) compared to 96 (67.6\\%) in the witness group. The presence of IMT>1 increases the risk of appearance of ACS 3.2 times, which has statistical significance (OR 3.2173; 95\\% CI 1.3501-7.666; p=0.0084). Conclusions: The patients with aortic degenerative stenosis associated with intima media thickness present a high risk of developing ACS.\n",

Anomaly detection is an important part of time series analysis, improving the quality of further analysis, such as prediction and forecasting. Thus, detecting sudden change points with normal behavior and using them to discriminate between abnormal behavior, i.e., outliers, is a crucial step used to minimize the false positive rate and to build accurate machine learning models for prediction and forecasting. In this paper, we propose a rule-based decision \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m that enhances anomaly detection in multivariate time series using change point detection. Our architecture uses a pipeline that automatically manages to detect real anomalies and remove the false positives introduced by change points. We employ both traditional and deep learning unsupervised algorithms, in total, five anomaly detection and five change point detection algorithms. Additionally, we propose a new confidence metric based on the support for a time series point to be an anomaly and the support for the same point to be a change point. In our experiments, we use a large real-world \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0mset containing multivariate time series about water consumption collected from smart meters. As an evaluation metric, we use Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The low MAE values show that the algorithms accurately determine anomalies and change points.

DOORS aims for architectural simplicity and achieves this by providing more control to the solution implementer, such that the behaviour of the object balancer can be tailored to the specifics of the problem addressed by the implementation. The proposed design for the balancer provides a simple relocation service, and a set of perpetually updated set of metrics, such that the solution implementer may define, 'plug in' and enforce a balancing policy out of an unlimited number of alternatives.\n",

      "<jats:p> During the microencapsulation process, the fish oil undergoes multiple changes in its physical properties such as bulkiness and dispersibility in aqueous phase and dry matrix. Autoxidation already occurred in the first stages of the microencapsulation process itself during emulsification and spray-drying. An efficient stabilization was achieved using a ternary combination of lipophilic antioxidants, synergistic compounds and a trace metal chelator, e.g. a combination of tocopherols, rich in the δ-derivative and low in the α-derivative, with ascorbyl palmitate and lecithin. Trace metal chelation by, e.g. Citrem or lecithin in combination with ascorbyl palmitate proved to be of particular importance in the emulsion, but not during the storage of the microencapsulated oil. In the microencapsulated oil, the addition of rosemary extract rich in carnosic acid to ternary blends of tocopherols, ascorbyl palmitate and lecithin or Citrem significantly retarded autoxidation. </jats:p>\n",

Resilience is a strongly demanding nonfunctional requirement for current computer networks, and one of the key factors to provide it is represented by loss tolerance. From wired to wireless networks, exchanged packets can be lost due to routing anomalies or temporary malfunctioning at the networking hardware or software. The experienced loss pattern can be exacerbated by severe weather conditions in wireless environments and/or due to effects of a disaster. Proper recovery schemes must be put in place in order to provide loss tolerance and move a step forward realizing disaster-resilient networks. This work contributes to such an objective by proposing a loss-tolerant scheme based on forward error correction and properly implementing it in a distributed manner, by having multiple nodes generating coded information to be used for the reconstruction of the lost \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m without retransmissions. The problem of placing and tuning such coding nodes within a communication infrastructure has been tackled according to a repeated game theory formulation, and a preliminary evaluation demonstrates the achievable improvements in the delivery success rate with limited costs.\n",

The past years showed us that the challenges that the health care \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m is facing are becoming more and more complex. Therefore, our model aims to ease the extraction of \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m for each patient. For example, \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m like blood pressure or body temperature can be recorded and measured. The efficiency is improved by adding sensors to collect \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m and send it through the proposed model. The model integrates an encryption module and a machine learning module because the goal is to gather \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m, encrypt it to ensure privacy and train the algorithm to provide the following result: for each patient, based on their symptomatology, the algorithm will automatically analyze each variable, provide a treatment plan and predict if the health condition of a patient is getting worse. For the latter, alerts will be sent to the medical staff.\n",
      "Nowadays, intelligent vehicles are becoming more and more important in the transportation field. What makes such a vehicle vulnerable is the number of interconnected components that individually have a strong security but can cause weakness points when they are connected. The challenge is to design and build a powerful \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m that uses both cyber-physical components. The proposed model is a \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m with integrated modules for fingerprint and face recognition to certify that a driver has the right to access the vehicle. The aim is to develop a security \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m for intelligent vehicles that can be also a secure keyless entry \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m using the power of biometrics.

Recent deep neural networks achieved superior results, demonstrating the feasibility of recognizing the expression of a user from a single picture or a video recording the face dynamics. Research studies reveal that the most discriminating portions of the face surfaces that contribute to the recognition of facial expressions are located on the mouth and the eyes. The restrictions for COVID pandemic reasons have also revealed that state-of-the-art solutions for the analysis of the face can severely fail due to the occlusions of using the facial masks. This study explores to what extend expression recognition can deal with occluded faces in presence of masks. To a fairer comparison, the analysis is performed in different occluded scenarios to effectively assess if the facial masks can really imply a decrease in the recognition accuracy. The experiments performed on two public \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0msets show that some famous top deep classifiers expose a significant reduction in accuracy in presence of masks up to half of the accuracy achieved in non-occluded conditions. Moreover, a relevant decrease in performance is also reported also in the case of occluded eyes but the overall drop in performance is not as severe as in presence of the facial masks, thus confirming that, like happens for face biometric recognition, occluded faces by facial mask still represent a challenging limitation for computer vision solutions.</jats:p>\n",

This method achieves the same result as the composite trapezoidal rule, but faster.

Numerical experiments are included to confirm its performance gain.\n",
      "The cybersecurity landscape in the last years has evolved significantly. Considering the fact that more than 281 million people were affected by cyber-threads in 2021 with an estimated financial impact of more than 15.680 million, the research for security mechanisms for better services has risen significantly. One of the most active trends in cybersecurity offensive procedures is perimeter breaching. This represents the incipient step that attackers take when they target external networks. On average the penetration of the internal networks takes no more than two days, therefore, the defense mechanisms should comply with this hard deadline. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a real-time approach that solves the privacy issues posed by network protocol profiling and surveillance. This can be done by disguising the generated traffic using different transport protocols like chat or gaming services. In order to choose the right channels which can be used, we identified the most prominent ones like Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) or Internet Relay Chat (IRC) chat and the AllJoyn network, a service used mainly for multiplayer communication in gaming environments on mobile terminals. We evaluate the proposed solution considering metrics such as time frame, speed, and rate limiting delay.\n",
      "<jats:p>Human interaction in natural language with computer \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0ms has been a prime focus of research, and the field of conversational agents (including chatbots and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0ms) has evolved significantly since 2009, with a major boost in 2016, especially for industrial solutions. Emergency \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0ms are crucial elements of today’s societies that can benefit from the advantages of intelligent human–computer interaction \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0ms. In this paper, we present two solutions for human-to-computer emergency \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0ms with critical deadlines that use a multi-layer FreeSwitch IVR solution and the Botpress chatbot platform. We are the pioneers in Romania who designed and implemented such a solution, which was evaluated in terms of performance and resource management concerning Quality of Service (QoS). Additionally, we assessed our Proof of Concept (PoC) with real \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m as part of the \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m for real-time Romanian transcription of speech and recognition of emotional states within emergency calls. Based on our feasibility research, we concluded that the telephony IVR best fits the requirements and specifications of the national 112 \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m, with the presented PoC ready to be integrated into the Romanian emergency \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m.</jats:p>\n",
      "<jats:p>The evolution of Natural Language Processing technologies transformed them into viable choices for various accessibility features and for facilitating interactions between humans and computers. A subset of them consists of speech processing \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0ms, such as Automatic Speech Recognition, which became more accurate and more popular as a result. In this article, we introduce an architecture built around various speech processing \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0ms to enhance Romanian emergency services. Our \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m is designed to help the operator evaluate various situations with the end goal of reducing the response times of emergency services. We also release the largest high-quality speech \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0mset of more than 150 h for Romanian. Our architecture includes an Automatic Speech Recognition model to transcribe calls automatically and augment the operator’s notes, as well as a Speech Recognition model to classify the caller’s emotions. We achieve state-of-the-art results on both tasks, while our demonstrator is designed to be integrated with the Romanian emergency \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m.</jats:p>\n",
      "Monitoring remotely the health and lifestyle of the seniors through smart devices brings some challenges due to the age-related impairments of the elderly or to the fact that the connected smart devices can be perceived as a vulnerable gateway to the whole digital \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m. Therefore, for mitigating the cybersecurity threats in such a healthcare model, the seniors needs and specificities should be addressed (carefully, with priority and taking into consideration the sensitive feature of health and personal \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m) through continuously updated security mechanisms and protocols. This paper aims to present the most relevant aspects related to all these and to demonstrate how they have been implemented in a remote health monitoring \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m designed to support a healthy, active and independent life of a senior in a smart device-based home.\n",
      "In figures, the cybersecurity landscape is one of the most across-the-border impactable trends in the last years, especially after the begging of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, by the end of Q4 of 2021, more than 281 million people have been victims of \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m breaches and cyber-threads, costing more than $42.96 million per day. A possible explanation is that most network operators do not provide any mechanism that blocks path tracing. Almost anybody with above-average network security knowledge can use public path tracing tools such as traceroute, enabling malicious users and thread factors to craft sophisticated cyber-attacks easily. Therefore, this paper proposes a cross-platform privacy overlay over the SOCKSv5 protocol. We evaluate the proposed solution in terms of latency, average throughput, and transfer rate.\n",
      "Starting with a successful connection between a client and a server made by Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee in 1989, the Internet has quickly evolved to a 4.57 billion of interconnected people. According to the Statistica website in [Cle20], this number of interconnected people encompasses more than 59% of the world population. More than 50% of the global Internet traffic is made by mobile devices, throught different wireless connections (2G, 3G, WiFi etc). The increased number of users, the constant changing topology, the limited resources and the heterogeneity of the devices have made challenging granting security in wireless mobile networks. Attacks like sybil [JZE+ 19], clone node [NSK+ 20], intelligent spoofing [GNF+ 20], denial of sleep [FFBY20] and denial of service [PS20] in wireless mobile networks are the focus of research nowadays.\n",
      "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a well-explored area from Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing with an extensive research community. Despite that, few languages, such as English and German, are well-resourced, whereas many other languages, such as Romanian, have scarce resources, especially in domain-specific \u001b[1m\u001b[31mapplications\u001b[0m. In this work, we address the NER problem in the legal domain from both Romanian and German languages and evaluate the performance of our proposed method based on domain adaptation. We employ multi-task learning to jointly train a neural network on two legal and general domains and perform adaptation among them. The results show that domain adaptation increase performances by a small amount, under 1%, while considerable improvements are in the recall metric.\n",
      "Many technology projects fail to be successful, one of the reasons being the lack of monitoring. It is on one hand the lack of \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m monitoring, which may cause hardware and kernel vulnerabilities, and on the other hand, the lack of \u001b[1m\u001b[31mapplications\u001b[0m and services monitoring, which may cause unsatisfied users with the outcome of the project. We propose the monitoring of DHuS, used for downloading sentinel \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m, which is important once because the \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m handles large sets of \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m and once because it is useful to see the user's interest in the provided services. The solution has two components, one of \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m monitoring and the other of log monitoring. Both results in sending \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m to graphical interfaces, hoping that the users of those two components may be able to improve the project based on the information provided.\n",

      "In \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdistributed \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0ms\u001b[0m such as mobile networks, problems like heterogeneity and real-time reliable responses represent constant challenges. Furthermore, reliable identification of the participants in mobile networks is a challenging research problem because of the susceptibility to security attacks. Also, reliable identification of participants means to be able to distinguish between the device and its user. In this paper, a multi-layer mechanism is proposed for reliable identification of devices and their users in mobile networks, based on the smartphone sensor \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m. The proposed model can uniquely identify both the device and the users by leveraging a mobile application that harvests mobile sensor \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m in various usage scenarios and analyse different usage patterns. Moreover, in order to achieve \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m confidentiality, a cryptographic scheme is integrated, based on the public key exchange mechanism. The obtained results show that the model proposed in this paper provides meaningful insights about user behavioral patterns, without special permissions and without disclosing the actual owner identity or biometric \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m.\n",
      "Keyphrase identification and classification is a Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval task that involves extracting relevant groups of words from a given text related to the main topic. In this work, we focus on extracting keyphrases from scientific documents. We introduce TA-DA, a Topic-Aware Domain Adaptation framework for keyphrase extraction that integrates Multi-Task Learning with Adversarial Training and Domain Adaptation. Our approach improves performance over baseline models by up to 5% in the exact match of the F1-score.\n",
      "Developing natural language processing (NLP) \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0ms for social media analysis remains an important topic in artificial intelligence research. This article introduces RoBERTweet, the first Transformer architecture trained on Romanian tweets. Our RoBERTweet comes in two versions, following the base and large architectures of BERT. The corpus used for pre-training the models represents a novelty for the Romanian NLP community and consists of all tweets collected from 2008 to 2022. Experiments show that RoBERTweet models outperform the previous general-domain Romanian and multilingual language models on three NLP tasks with tweet inputs: emotion detection, sexist language identification, and named entity recognition. We make our models (https://huggingface.co/Iulian277/ro-bert-tweet ) and the newly created corpus (https://huggingface.co/\u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0msets/Iulian277/romanian-tweets ) of Romanian tweets freely available.\n",
      "Satire detection and sentiment analysis are intensively explored natural language processing (NLP) tasks that study the identification of the satirical tone from texts and extracting sentiments in relationship with their targets. In languages with fewer research resources, an alternative is to produce artificial examples based on character-level adversarial processes to overcome \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0mset size limitations. Such samples are proven to act as a regularization method, thus improving the robustness of models. In this work, we improve the well-known NLP models (i.e., Convolutional Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Bidirectional GRUs) with adversarial training and capsule networks. The fine-tuned models are used for satire detection and sentiment analysis tasks in the Romanian language. The proposed framework outperforms the existing methods for the two tasks, achieving up to 99.08% accuracy, thus confirming the improvements added by the capsule layers and the adversarial training in NLP approaches.\n",
      "The rise of mobile devices has revolutionized the way we interact with technology, enabling us to carry powerful computing devices in our pockets. However, with the increasing amount of sensitive information stored on these devices, trust has become a crucial factor in mobile security. Fingerprinting, which utilizes sensors embedded in mobile devices to recognize the unique characteristics of the user, has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing trust in mobile devices. Rapid response capability is crucial for the structure of a Peer-to-Peer \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystem\u001b[0m, as the nodes within the network have the flexibility to enter or exit at any moment without prior notification. This paper presents a novel approach to trust and reputation of mobile devices that use sensor fingerprinting techniques. Our approach uniquely identifies the nodes in a Peer-to-Peer network based on a spherical overlay such as TSPeer. We also discuss the challenges and limitations of this approach and evaluate it through simulation with real-life \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m sets.\n",
      "Nowadays \u001b[1m\u001b[31mBig Data\u001b[0m has become a topic that has demonstrated its practical value in the latest years and can no longer be ignored. The need for employees who understand \u001b[1m\u001b[31mBig Data\u001b[0m and know to work with tools that have arisen to analyze it is clear when we look at the exponential growth trend in the number of jobs for \u001b[1m\u001b[31mdata\u001b[0m scientists over the past two years.

      "Skin cancer is a treatable disease if discovered early. We provide a production-specific solution to the skin cancer classification problem that matches human performance in melanoma identification by training a vision transformer on melanoma medical images annotated by experts. Since inference cost, both time and memory wise is important in practice, we employ knowledge distillation to obtain a model that retains 98.33% of the teachers balanced multi-class accuracy, at a fraction of the cost. Memory-wise, our model is 49.60% smaller than the teacher. Time-wise, our solution is 69.25% faster on GPU and 97.96% faster on CPU. By adding classification heads at each level of the transformer and employing a cascading distillation process, we improve the balanced multi-class accuracy of the base model by 2.1%, while creating a range of models of various sizes but comparable performance. We provide the code at https://github.com/Longman-Stan/SkinDistilVit.\n",

The goal is to develop an improved VAD model based on the analysis of SpeechBrains performance and provide a detailed perspective on the differences and similarities between these models. The study focuses on the technologies and algorithms used by each model and utilizes experimental methods to evaluate their performance. The experimental results show that SpeechBrain performs the best, with an average recall value of 0.97 and a precision value of 0.96. Our research endeavors have led to the refinement of the existing VAD model, resulting in even more compelling performance metrics. The improved model achieves a recall value of 0.98 and \n"
