      "The MonALISA (Monitoring Agents in A Large Integrated \u001b[1m\u001b[31mServices\u001b[0m Architecture) system provides a distributed service architecture which is used to collect and process monitoring information. While its initial target field of application is \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms and Grid \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m supporting data processing and analysis for global high energy and nuclear physics collaborations, MonALISA is broadly applicable to many fields of “data intensive” science, and to the monitoring and management of major research and education \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms. MonALISA is based on a scalable Dynamic Distributed \u001b[1m\u001b[31mServices\u001b[0m Architecture), and is implemented in Java using JINI and WSDL technologies. The scalability of the system derives from the use of a multi threaded engine to host a variety of loosely coupled self-describing dynamic services, the ability of each service to register itself and then to be discovered and used by any other services, or clients that require such information. The framework integrates many existing monitoring tools and procedures to collect parameters describing computational nodes, applications and \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m performance. Specialized \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m agents are used in the MonALISA framework to perform global optimization tasks or help and improve the operation of large distributed system by performing supervising tasks for different applications or real time parameters.

      "Introduction Data-intensive computing is now starting to be considered as the basis for a new, fourth paradigm for science. Two factors are encouraging this trend. First, vast amounts of data are becoming available in more and more application areas.

This allows unifying knowledge acquired through the three past paradigms for scientific research (theory, experiments, and simulations) with vast amounts of multidisciplinary data.

      "This paper discusses the latest generation of the MONARC (MOdels of Networked Analysis at Regional Centers) simulation framework, as a design and modelling tool for large scale distributed \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m applied to HEP experiments. A process-oriented approach for discrete event simulation is well-suited for describing concurrent running programs, as well as the stochastic arrival patterns that characterize how such \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m are used. The simulation engine is based on Threaded Objects (or Active Objects), which offer great flexibility in simulating the complex behavior of distributed data processing programs. The engine provides an appropriate scheduling mechanism for the Active objects with support for interrupts. This approach offers a natural way of describing complex running programs that are data dependent and which concurrently compete for shared resources as well as large numbers of concurrent data transfers on shared resources. The framework provides a complete set of basic components (processing nodes, data servers, \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m components) together with dynamically loadable decision units (scheduling or data replication modules) for easily building complex Computing Model simulations. Examples of simulating complex data processing \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m are presented, and the way the framework is used to compare different decision making algorithms or to optimize the overall Grid architecture and/or the policies that govern the Grid's use.\n",
      "The validation of \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m ad hoc technologies relies almost exclusively on modeling and simulation. In this paper we present a novel mobility model based on social \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m theory. The mobility model is designed to accurately reflect the realistic mobility of the involved actors in various VANET simulation scenarios. This is much needed as, in order to have a high degree of confidence in the validation of various technologies using simulation, the mobility model (as well as the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m model) must act very realistic. However, most of the mobility models currently used are very simplistic. The mobility model being presented is part of a VNSim, a generic VANET simulator designed to evaluate a wide range of VANET technologies. We present several results obtained using this mobility model. The results show that the presented mobility model offers a good approximation of real-world movement patterns.\n",

Recently various opportunistic routing or dissemination algorithms were proposed and evaluated in different scenarios emulating real-world phenomena as close as possible. In this paper we present an experiment performed at the Politehnica University of Bucharest in which we collected social and mobiltity data to evaluate opportunistic routing and dissemination algorithms. We present an analysis of our findings, highlighting key social and mobility behavior factors that can influence such opportunistic solutions. Most importantly, we show that by adding knowledge such as social links\n",
      "Data dissemination in opportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms poses a series of challenges, since there is no central entity aware of all the nodes' subscriptions. Each individual node is only aware of its own interests and those of a node that it is contact with, if any. Thus, dissemination is generally performed using epidemic algorithms that flood the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m, but they have the disadvantage that the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m overhead and congestion are very high. In this paper, we propose ONSIDE, an algorithm that leverages a node's online social connections (i.e. friends on social \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms such as Facebook or Google+), its interests and the history of contacts, in order to decrease congestion and required bandwidth, while not affecting the overall \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m's hit rate and the delivery latency. We present the results of testing our algorithm using an opportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m emulator and three mobility traces taken in different environments.\n",

For this reason, traditional routing mechanisms are no longer suitable. To increase the probability of successfull message delivery, we propose SPRINT, an opportunistic routing algorithm that introduces an additional routing criterion: online social information about nodes. Furthermore, previous results show that, for particular environments, contacts between devices in opportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms are highly predictable. When users follow rare events-based mobility patterns, we show that human mobility can be approximated as a Poisson distribution.

      "Scheduling is a key component for performance guarantees in the case of distributed applications running in large scale heterogeneous environments.

      "In particular types of Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTN) such as Opportunistic Mobile Networks, node connectivity is transient.

We argue that in such an approach, nodes with high social popularity may quickly deplete their energy resources - and, therefore, might be unwilling to participate in the routing process. We show that social-based routing algorithms such as BUBBLE Rap are prone to this behavior, and introduce energy awareness as an important criterion in the routing decision. We present experimental results showing that our approach delivers performances similar to BUBBLE Rap, whilst balancing the energy consumption between nodes in the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m.\n",

As such, we explore the predictability of user synergy based on tracing data collected from \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m phone users in academic and office environments.

      "<jats:p>Failure detection is a fundamental building block for ensuring fault tolerance in large scale distributed \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m. It is also a difficult problem. Resources under heavy loads can be mistaken as being failed. The failure of a \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m link can be detected by the lack of a response, but this also occurs when a computational resource fails. Although progress has been made, no existing approach provides a system that covers all essential aspects related to a distributed environment. This paper presents a failure detection system based on adaptive, decentralized failure detectors. The system is developed as an independent substrate, working asynchronously and independent of the application flow. It uses a hierarchical protocol, creating a clustering mechanism that ensures a dynamic configuration and traffic optimization. It also uses a gossip strategy for failure detection at local levels to minimize detection time and remove wrong suspicions. Results show that the system scales with the number of monitored resources, while still considering the QoS requirements of both applications and resources.</jats:p>\n",

      "Scheduling is an important research topic in grid computing. This is due to the aim of grids to offer high quality services to members of virtual organizations based on the efficient use of the available resources. This goal can be achieved through a good scheduling strategy applied to the local level (clusters) and global level (entire system) of grids. Since the scheduling problem is NP complete, we can afford only sub-optimal solutions to this problem. In addition, the highly dynamic behavior of grid components (users, processes, resources) makes more difficult the finding of a good scheduling solution. In this paper we propose a new approach to solving the scheduling problem by simulation. Using a simulator has the merit to shorten the distance between the real grid system and the model used for its analysis. In order to transform the simulator into a useful tool able to cope with the grid dynamicity, we propose a\n",

      "Generally, data dissemination in opportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m uses flooding to ensure that content is spread to interested subscribers. However, this might lead to congestion and high overhead, so alternative solutions are required. In this article, we propose leveraging context information such as node interests, social connections and predictions based on contact history, in order to decrease congestion without affecting the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms hit rate and delivery latency. Thus, we first propose a basic interest-based dissemination algorithm, to show that nodes tend to group together based on interests. Then, we present ONSIDE, an algorithm that also uses other types of context information to select the nodes that act as forwarders. Finally, we propose five heuristics for sorting the messages in a nodes memory, and show how each of them affects hit rate, delivery latency and congestion.\n",

We propose a data-trust security model designed for VANETs based on social \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m theories. Drivers receiving data about traffic congestion or safety warnings can use the model to evaluate the trust in the received information. The model computes a trust index for each message based on the relevance of the event. It also uses a gossiping approach to disseminate data-trust indexes between vehicles, increasing the accuracy in the trustworthiness of an event and assuring the privacy by hiding the original event sources.

Opportunistic data dissemination also raises questions concerning user privacy and incentives. Such problems are addressed differently by various opportunistic data dissemination techniques.

Unlike other ad hoc \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms, mobility of nodes is seen as an interesting feature to deliver information from a source node to a destination node. New forwarding schemes have been proposed to deal with the intermittent communications carried out by nodes in delay tolerant \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms. Most forwarding schemes assume that nodes are divided into social communities and the communications are likely to be established between two nodes belonging to the same community.

One such approach is represented by opportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ming, which is based on a store-carry-and-forward paradigm, where nodes store data and carry it until they reach a suitable node for forwarding. The problem in such \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms is how to decide what the next hop will be, since nodes do not have a global view of the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m. We propose using the social \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m information of a node when performing routing, since a node is more likely to encounter members of its own social community than other nodes. In addition, we approximate a node’s contact as a Poisson distribution and show that we can predict its future behavior based on the contact history. Furthermore, since opportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m nodes may be selfish, we improve our solution by adding a selfish node detection and avoidance mechanism, which can help reduce the number of unnecessary messages sent in the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m, and thus avoid congestion and decrease battery consumption.

One such approach is opportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ming, which is based on a store-carry-and-forward paradigm, where nodes store data and carry it until they reach a suitable node for forwarding.

      "Even though scheduling in a distributed system was debated for many years, the platforms and the job types are changing everyday. This is why we need special algorithms based on new applications requirements, especially when a application is deployed in a Cloud environment. One of the most important framework used for large-scale data processing in Clouds is Hadoop and its extensions. Hadoop framework comes with default algorithms like FIFO, Fair Scheduler or Capacity Scheduler, and Hadoop on Demand. These scheduling algorithms are focused on a different and single constraint. It is hard to satisfy multiple constraints and to have a lot of objectives in the same time. After summarizing the most common schedulers, showing the need of each one in the moment it appeared on the market, this paper presents MOMC, a multi-objective and multi-constrained scheduling algorithm of many tasks in Hadoop. MOMC implementation focuses on two objectives: avoiding resource contention and having an optimal workload of the cluster, and two constraints: deadline and budget. To compare the algorithms based on different metrics, we use Scheduling Load Simulator, which is integrated in Hadoop framework and helps the developers to spend less time on testing. As killer application that generate many tasks we have chosen processing task for the Million Song Dataset, which is a set of data contains metadata for one million commercially-available songs.\n",

Efficient management of heterogeneous resources requires uniform overlay \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m with well-established joining and routing protocols.

      "Disaster and emergency management refers to a range of activities designed to maintain control over crisis situations, providing the rescue and assistance equipment with a framework for helping victims and reducing its impact. The range of activities include prevention, advance warning, early detection, analysis of the problem and assessment of scope, notification of the public and appropriate authorities, mobilization of a response, containment of damage, and relief and medical care for those affected. One of the challenges in emergency scenarios is the fact that communications can be interrupted, cutting the information flow. This lack of communication infrastructure makes an appropriate response to the disaster more challenging, and leads to reduced quality of services experienced by vulnerable civilians. As an example, emergency scenarios with big agglomerations of people or traffic jams following accidents demand a unified communication infrastructure to optimize the response and decision making. This can be overcome using self-configured wireless \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms, because they do not require any pre-existing infrastructure to be established, and are easy to deploy and fast to operate. The continuous use of modern smartphones facilitates the accessibility to wireless technologies.

      "RDF Schema is a basic and yet very important language for specifying ontologies in the context of Semantic Web. Ontologies can be used to obtain more information from that explicitly stated. Traditionally, the process of revealing implicit knowledge, known as inference or reasoning, is realised by a reasoner - a component which either processes data to infer all conclusions in advance or, given a query, infers all implicit answers during a query evaluation process. In this paper, we present an alternative approach based on structuring data in a database according to underlying ontologies. This knowledge structure is employed for directing query evaluation to data relevant for the given query. Thus, this method reduces reasoning to retrieving. We show that the proposed schema preserves the semantics of RDF and RDFS in standard use cases.\n",
      "The development of semantic agent frameworks is strongly influenced by the means for representing and reasoning about knowledge. Nevertheless, when faced with decision-making in multi-agent environments, current approaches are limited in their ability to model strategic interactions. As a result, ontological approaches such as those based on OWL, offer only a reactive behavior for such interactions. We argue that a game-theoretic approach is more suitable when faced with modeling cooperation in Multi-Agent Systems. We introduce a new type of games, Boolean Games with Currency, which combine features of Boolean Games, with the transferable payoff setting. We also give a computational characterisation for a solution concept for coalitional stability: the core. We show that the core of a Boolean Game with Currency is always non-empty, and we prove the core membership problem to be co-NP complete.\n",

The prediction model is based on actual parameter values and historical information, both provided by the MonALISA monitoring system and its extensions: repository and ApMon. The prediction system architecture is extensible, in the sense that other monitoring parameters can be easily added and new prediction models can be included. The predictions of Grid resources are used in meta-scheduling for different types of tasks, especially tasks with dependencies that have an associated communication cost. The significant improvements obtained for scheduling optimization, with an immediate effect on load balancing and resource utilization are presented.\n",

Processing and storing ever-larger volumes of data introduces new challenges, and consequently, we need to constantly develop new technological means to face them. Massive parallel processing platforms are the answer and are already being developed over distributed \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m (i.e., over cloud or fog computing). However, the problem is that such platforms need to support a wide variety of applications, coming with different processing requirements. Thus, self-* behavior is a must in this context, referring to self-managing characteristics of distributed computing resources, their capability to adapt to unpredictable changes while hiding intrinsic complexity to operators and users.

Autonomic Computing is facilitated by self-management capabilities that modern LSDS introduce, such as self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimization, and self-protection properties. In LSDS, an important characteristic is dependability (defined in terms of reliability, availability, safety and security of the operating system). Increased dependability means the system has to be able to detect, recover, and tolerate every possible deviation from its normal operation, and a wide area of Autonomic Computing research is today dedicated to this subject.

The challenge is that in \u001b[1m\u001b[31mBig Data\u001b[0m platforms applications and users, and even the distributed resources themselves, introduce unpredictable dynamic behavior. Autonomic Computing is considered one great challenge today faced by the IT industry, in need of finding good answers to how to conquer the growing complexity of large-scale \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m and how to adequately cope with the many issues faced by truly \u001b[1m\u001b[31mBig Data\u001b[0m processing.

      "The current knowledge-based modeling languages have no acceptable mechanisms for working with time and the time-dependent properties of the described applications. Timedependent aspects are usually represented using mechanisms for specifying static parameters of the described application, yielding complex models that are difficult to maintain, extend, and reason about. We argue that a modeling approach focused on the declarative and explicit specification of time-dependencies is more suitable. We propose a modeling method based on fluid qualities, and a declarative language for building time-dependent models that can be efficiently processed. The language has similarities with CLIPS and Prolog, and has direct applications in areas centered on intelligent device control.\n",

      "Distributed computing is increasingly being viewed as the next phase of Large Scale Distributed Systems (LSDSs). However, the vision of large scale resource sharing is not yet a reality in many areas-Grid computing is an evolving area of computing, where standards and technology are still being developed to enable this new paradigm. Hence, in this paper we analyze the current development of middleware tools for LSDS, from multiple perspectives: architecture, applications and market research. For each perspective we are interested in relevant technologies used in undergoing projects, existing products or services and useful design issues. In the end, based on this approach, we draw some conclusions regarding the future research directions in this area. Subjects: Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.

      "The advent of IoT (the Internet of Things) has led to the necessity of fast and secure communication between devices, ranging from small sensors to top-of-the-line smartphones or laptops. One proposal for IoT communication is through 5G, which is estimated to be rolled out by 2020. However, the infrastructure for 5G communication might not always be present, or it should be avoided because of congestion. Moreover, employing it in smaller IoT \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms can prove too expensive in some cases, while some small devices such as sensors might not even have 5G capabilities (or having them would greatly increase their price). For these reasons, opportunistic communication is an alternative for IoTs where \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m broadband connections cannot be used. \u001b[1m\u001b[31mOpportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms\u001b[0m are formed of \u001b[1m\u001b[31m\u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m devices\u001b[0m (such as smartphones and tablets belonging to social users) that communicate using close-range protocols such as Bluetooth or WiFi Direct. These \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms are based on the store-carry-and-forward paradigm, where contacts between nodes are used opportunistically to transport data from a source to a destination, even though the two nodes might never be in direct communication range. Data dissemination assumes that nodes do not send directed messages (i.e., from a source to a pre-set destination), instead using channels to perform communication. Nodes are able to subscribe to channels, which are represented by interests (e.g., a node interested in ``IT'' will need to receive all messages marked with that tag). The main requirement of opportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms is that the participating nodes should be altruistic, since communication is performed with the help of other nodes. However, this might not always be the case, since selfish nodes might decide that they do not want to help others. Such nodes should be detected and not allowed to participate in the dissemination process. This way, their messages will not be delivered, so they will be forced to become altruistic if they want a good \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ming experience. In this chapter, we propose a method for detecting and punishing selfish nodes in opportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms dissemination, using gossiping mechanisms over the dynamic social \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m. Nodes learn about the behavior of other nodes and, when a contact occurs, share this information with an encountered device. We apply this method to an existing social and interest-based dissemination algorithm (ONSIDE) and show that it correctly detects and punishes selfish nodes, thus increasing the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m's behavior in terms of message delivery and congestion.\n",

Fortunately, in the last years various Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) demonstrate innovative services relating to different modes of transport and traffic management, and enable various users to be better informed and make safer, more coordinated, and’smarter’use of transport \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms. For such \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m, a lot of attention has been dedicated to develop realistic models of roads and of the vehicle mobility, by exploiting the extensive literature developed in the field of transportation \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m, eg, models of how cars move along a road. Here, we present the realization of a morerealistic simulation tool, Sim2Car. The simulator uses as input data real-life traces collected over long periods of time, involving potentially thousands of drivers, to provide a realistic support mobility model for high-level methods and techniques designed to optimize traffic. On top, developers can simulate advanced traffic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ming solutions and intelligent transportation applications, under real-world conditions. We present our results for an application designed to optimize the costs involved in using navigators, that actively incorporate solutions borrowed from opportunistic computing and context data to optimize the user‘s experience.\n",
      "Mobility is intrinsic to human behavior and influences the dynamics of all social phenomena. As such, technology has not remained indifferent to the imprint of mobility. Today we are seeing a shift in tides as the focus is turning towards portability, as well as performance; \u001b[1m\u001b[31m\u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m devices\u001b[0m and wireless technologies have become ubiquitous in order to fulfil the needs of modern society. Today the need for mobility management is gradually becoming one of the most important and challenging problems in pervasive computing. In this chapter, we present an analysis of research activities targeting mobility. We present the challenges of analyzing and understanding the mobility (is mobility something that is inherently predictable? are humans socially inclined to follow certain paths?), to techniques that use mobility results to facilitate the interaction between peers in \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms, or detect the popularity of certain locations.

We emphasize the entire process of studying the dynamics of \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m users, from collecting the user data, to modelling mobility and interactions, and finally to exploring the predictability of human behavior. We point out the challenges and the limitations of such an endeavour. Furthermore, we propose techniques and methodologies to study the mobility and synergy of \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m users and we show their applicability on two case studies. ?? 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",
      "In particular types of Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTN) such as Opportunistic Mobile Networks, node connectivity is transient. For this reason, traditional routing mechanisms are no longer suitable. New approaches use social relations between \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m users as a criterion for the routing process. We argue that in such an approach, nodes with high social popularity may become congested. We show that social-based routing algorithms such as Bubble Rap are prone to congestion, and introduce two algorithms Outer and LowerEps. We present experimental results showing that the latter outperform Bubble Rap and solve the congestion problem.\n",

They communicate when in range, using a store-carry-and-forward paradigm. We believe that opportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms can be deployed in closed environments if there is a certainty that messages sent in the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m eventually reach their destination. Therefore, we propose the addition of social data to existing opportunistic routing algorithms. We investigate our approach using two traces collected in different environments and we present an analysis of our findings. Most importantly, we show that by adding knowledge such as social links between participants, the performance of the opportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m can be improved. \n",

      "EN Context-aware computing is a paradigm that relies on the active use of information coming from a variety of sources, ranging from smartphones to sensors. The paradigm usually leads to storing large volumes of data that need to be processed to derive higher-level context information. The paper presents a cloud-based storage layer for managing sensitive context data. To handle the storage and aggregation of context data for context-aware applications, Clouds are perfect candidates. But a Cloud platform for context-aware computing needs to cope with several requirements: high concurrent access (all data needs to be available to potentially a large number of users), mobility support (such platform should actively use the caches on \u001b[1m\u001b[31m\u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m devices\u001b[0m whenever possible, but also cope with storage size limitations), real-time access guarantees–local caches should be located closer to the end-user whenever possible, and persistency (for traceability, a history of the context data should remain available). BlobSeer, a framework for Cloud data storage, is a perfect candidate for storing context data for large-scale applications. It offers capabilities such as persistency, concurrency and support for flexible storage schema requirement. On top of BlobSeer, Context Aware Framework is designed as an extension that offers context-aware data management to higherlevel applications, and enables scalable high-throughput under high-concurrency.

For the local IDS we propose a hybrid solution that combines two intrusion detection methods (pattern matching and anomaly detection) to increase detection's precision. The global IDS efficiently detects application-based and resource-based attacks that cannot be detected at the local level.\n",

In addition, model checking techniques can be naturally applied. In this paper, we describe a modeling method and declarative language based on fluid qualities.

The need for large-scale tracking, for thousands or even millions of individuals, over large areas such as cities, requires the use of alternative techniques. WiFi tracking is a scalable solution that has gained attention recently. This method permits unobtrusive tracking of large crowds, at a reduced cost. However, extracting knowledge from the data gathered through WiFi tracking is not simple, due to the low positional accuracy and the dependence on signals generated by the tracked device, which are irregular and sparse. To facilitate further data analysis, we can partition individual trajectories into periods of stops and moves. This abstraction level is fundamental, and it opens the way for answering complex questions about visited locations or even social behavior. Determining stops and movements has been previously addressed for tracking data gathered using GPS. GPS trajectories have higher positional accuracy at a fixed, higher frequency as compared to trajectories obtained through WiFi. However, even with the increase in accuracy, the problem, of separating traces in periods of stops and movements, remains similar to the one we encountered for WiFi tracking. In this paper, we study three algorithms for determining stops and movements for GPS-based datasets and explore their applicability to WiFi-based data.

      "Privacy-preserved tracking of WiFi-enabled devices such as smartphones offers a highly scalable solution for large-scale crowd movement studies. However, extracting knowledge out of pedestrian-tracking data acquired this way is not simple. This is, generally, due to the inherent inaccuracy of the measurement technique. Segmenting an individual's trajectory data into periods of stops and moves is a fundamental step in analyzing crowds' movement. Such distinctions allow us to answer advanced questions regarding visited locations or even social behavior. Algorithms previously designed for distinguishing movements from stay periods, assume datasets are gathered using GPS, which offers precise positioning.

      " 2018 IEEE. In large \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m with many sensors and devices that collect information, the infrastructure costs can reach extremely high values, since all the nodes in the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m need to be connected to a server so they can upload their data and have them processed. However, in order to reduce such costs, the sensors and devices can communicate with each other, exchanging data when in close proximity. Thus, an opportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m (ON) is created, where devices follow a store-carry-forward paradigm, deciding upon each contact whether the encountered node is the next hop for the data they are carrying. Besides their many advantages, opportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms present several challenges, one of the most disputed being the achievement of consensus between the nodes of the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m. The lack of a central entity which could gather information and validate messages leaves this task to the goodwill and collaboration between nodes. Consensus is required in order for the nodes to depend on and trust the data that they receive in the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m. In this paper, we address the problem of reaching consensus in opportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms. We propose an algorithm for consensus in ONs and show that it is able to correctly select several leaders for each community of devices, which then collaborate between each other to reach consensus. Furthermore, we present two scenarios where opportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms can be employed and consensus is required.\n",

      "Imagine you are lost in a random labyrinth, looking for the exit. Or that you are the ancient Greek hero Theseus searching for the Minotaur in such a labyrinth. How can we even describe a random labyrinth? Let us represent it by a \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m with n nodes, where each pair of nodes is connected only if you get heads after tossing a biased coin. Imagine the Minotaur standing in one of these nodes, with the power to determine how connected the labyrinth is by controlling the bias of the coin whose tossing decides if each pair of nodes is connected or not. Recently, it was proven that above a certain threshold of connectivity in the labyrinth (related to the bias of the coin), a quantum computer would offer the fastest way for Theseus to find the Minotaur (https://journals. aps. org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett. 116.100501). But below this threshold, that quantum speed-up would be lost, and Theseus would take longer to find his half-human enemy. Is there something Theseus can do about it, or can the Minotaur always escape Theseus' quantum computational advantage by simply choosing the adequate bias for the coin? Imagine now that Theseus has the power to replace the entire labyrinth at regular time intervals. Each time, he deletes all the connections between the nodes, and then introduces new random connections by tossing the biased coin for each pair of nodes, thus effectively generating a new labyrinth. The number of nodes remains fixed. And the Minotaur is still the one deciding how connected or not the new random labyrinth is overall, by setting the bias of the coin. But Theseus can re-generate the labyrinth as frequently as he wants (see …\n",

      "MANIAC Challenge raises a problem of game theory, different players strategies intertwine and the success of any player is dependent on the actions of all players in the system. A truly fair scenario is when all the strategies are identical, all the nodes co-operate and they all equally share the rewards and risks that come with every transfer. A successful strategy is one that tries to diverge from the equilibrium to maximize its own gains and it manages to do so. We propose the wolf-pack strategy. Unlike standard game-theory based strategies, our strategy does not penalize the nodes that diverge from fairness or from equilibrium, as we believe most nodes will do so in an attempt to get an advantage over the other nodes. The wolf-pack strategy will try to always find the most successful node or nodes and penalize them. We believe that just like in nature, a number of small predators can take down the bigger, more profitable ones. Furthermore during the Challenge we test two different strategies that provide completely opposite results. These offer a clear picture of what the best strategy is and the problems of the current system.\n",

A much cheaper alternative consists in the introduction of advanced intelligent traffic control \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m to manage traffic and increase the efficiency of the already existing highways. Intelligent lane reservation system for highways (ILRSH) is such a software control system. It is designed to assist and automate the use of a highway lane as a reserved lane. The idea is to allow and support drivers to travel at a speed higher, if in return they are willing to pay a small fee to reserve an empty virtual slot on the reserved lane. This slot is valid for a portion and of the highway and a time window, so each driver pays the fee depending thier  its travelling needs. In return, drivers are guaranteed a congestion-free travel on that portion. In this paper,  we present the proposed architecture of the ILRSH and its sub\u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m.

The taxonomy could be used to identify architectural approaches and issues that have not been fully explored in the research. The resource management system could support different users constrains, so the multiple policies is provided. In general, requiring the RMS to support multiple policies can compel the scheduling mechanisms to solve a multi-criteria optimization problem.

The constantly increasing demand for large scale distributed applications has brought on a need for tools and frameworks that ease their development. The main role of these tools and frameworks is to assist the developer in implementing some common functionalities and patterns that are specific to distributed applications – for example, dividing a large computational task into smaller subtasks to be executed on multiple machines, or sending e-mails automatically, or managing the access to resources in a secure way. One of the most important issues that the application development frameworks have to address is the abstraction of the underlying middleware: their main objective is to relieve the application programmer from the effort of dealing with lowerlevel components. Another important aspect is the performance of the communication among the application components; hence, some development tools are specifically targeted to optimizing the communication performance. We also observe an increasing interest in the interoperability among applications developed with different platforms, which has led to many standardization initiatives.

Together with the extension of the application domains, new requirements have emerged for large scale distributed \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m.

The characteristics of these \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m pose problems to ensuring fault tolerance especially because of their complexity, involving many resources and users geographically distributed, because of the volatility of resources that are available only for limited amounts of time, and because of the constraints imposed by the applications and resource owners.

The aim of this chapter is to realize a survey study of existing work and trends in distributed \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m monitoring by introducing the involved concepts and requirements, techniques, models and related standardization activities. Monitoring can be defined as the process of dynamic collection, interpretation and presentation of information concerning the characteristics and status of resources of interest. It is needed for various purposes such as debugging, testing, program visualization and animation. It may also be used for general management activities, which have a more permanent and continuous nature (performance management, configuration management, fault management, security management, etc.). In this case the behavior of the system is observed and monitoring information is gathered. This information is used to make management decisions and perform the appropriate control actions on the system. Unlike monitoring which is generally a passive process, control actively changes the behavior of the managed system and it has to be considered and modeled separately.

The first part of the chapter presents a classification of scheduling problems, methods that are relevant for the solution procedures, and computational complexity. The scheduling models are presented based on \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m architecture described in Resource Management chapter. This firs part also provides a critical analysis of most important algorithms from different points of view, such as static versus dynamic policies, objective functions, applications models, adaptation, QoS constraints and strategies dealing with dynamic behavior of resources.

Multi-criteria optimization mechanisms for users and \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m constrain (e.g. load-balancing, minimization of execution time) are described and analyzed in this chapter.

It is also presented the implementation issues for scheduler tools. Since it is not possible to cover the whole area of scheduling in one chapter, some restrictions are imposed. Firstly, the chapter presents only Scheduling for Large Scale Distributed Systems (LSDS), without single system scheduling. Secondly, some interesting topics of fault tolerance (re-scheduling) are not analyzed in this chapter.\n",
      "Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANET) are a particular type of wireless adhoc \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms. They are formed when equipping vehicles on the roads with short range wireless communication devices. Validation of \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m ad hoc \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m protocols relies almost exclusively on simulation. The value of the validation is, therefore, highly dependent on how realistic the movement models used in the simulations are. However, most widely used models are currently very simplistic, their focus being the ease of implementation rather than soundness of foundation. As a consequence, simulation results of protocols are often based on randomly generated movement patterns and, therefore, may differ considerably from those that can be obtained by deploying the system in real scenarios. In this we propose a new mobility model based on the social \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m theory. The mobility model creates movement pattern by taking into consideration the social relationship among the individuals, social relationship that might change depending on the simulation time. We also present the results obtained in validating our model using the realistic vehicular traces designed at the ETH Zurich institute.\n",
      "Smart Devices provide a variety of specific computing and connection features that influence user quality needs. In some cases, \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m applications have user interfaces and features that do not fully meet user requirements. An important area of research is the identification of those key elements that can be characterize the quality of a \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m application within a usability model. The purpose of this article is to identify, based on a comparative analysis and existing usage patterns adapted to \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m applications, those features of usability that best meet the quality requirements of users. The study analyzes five classic models of usability and three \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m-friendly models, identifying a number of 14 elements that can shape the usability of a \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m application. line)\n",
      "The large number of \u001b[1m\u001b[31m\u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m devices\u001b[0m existing nowadays has led to the evolution of \u001b[1m\u001b[31m\u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m cloud computing\u001b[0m towards bringing data and computations closer to the nodes. This has manifested first in the shape of fog and edge computing, where an additional communication and processing layer is added at the edge of the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m. However, the fast adoption of the Internet of Things has shown the limitations of even this model, so the focus now is moving towards another layer that is one level below: the ad hoc \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m composed of the \u001b[1m\u001b[31m\u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m devices\u001b[0m themselves. One paradigm based on this model is Drop Computing, where nodes that need to do some computations first attempt to process them through the help of neighbor devices using close-range communication (such as Wi-Fi Direct or Bluetooth), and only then do they attempt to contact the fog/edge nodes or the cloud itself. In this paper, we propose an Android implementation of the device-to-device layer of Drop Computing. On top of this implementation, we present an application that creates a video collage from multiple photos using ffmpeg with the help of neighboring nodes through close-range communication using the HYCCUPS and Google Nearby frameworks. Through experiments on four Android devices, we show that our implementation can drastically decrease CPU usage per device, which in turn increases the overall quality of experience for Android users. Furthermore, the total battery consumption is lowered, since nodes have less computations to perform and the CPU cores spend less time in higher frequencies.\n",

Thus, contacts are seen as opportunities to move data towards the destination. In such \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms the routing protocol is of vital importance--and today we witness quite a number of routing algorithms that have been proposed to maximize the success rate of message delivery whilst minimizing the communication cost.

      "Nowadays, handheld devices such as smart phones have become an everyday necessity as more and more features and services can be provided in such small packages. The diversity of the different sensors that are embedded in these devices (such as accelerometer, light sensors, etc.) provide the required foundation for the emergence of specialized applications that are capable of serving all kinds of purposes. By taking advantage of this specialized hardware found in smart phones, not only it has become feasible to constantly sense and gather information from the device's environment, but it has also become an effortless task to transmit the collected data to any individual or organization in a plethora of forms. This paper serves as an evaluation method for a location based Android application, SeniorTracker, by presenting a comparison between two applications that are both used for tracking down a device. While both have quite a similar purpose, the way they go about it as well as the ways the application itself can be utilized, drastically differs. SeniorTracker's main purpose lies in the retrieval of the coordinates of a device in case it is located somewhere it is not expected to be, enabling this way the finding of missing persons. The comparison was mainly focused on the performance of both applications when it comes to location retrieval and energy consumption while keeping in mind the respective tasks that each of them were designed to fulfill.\n",

      "Traditional technologies and techniques for data storage and analysis are not efficient anymore, in the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mBig Data\u001b[0m and Data Science era, as the data is produced in high-volumes, come with high-velocity, has high-variety and there is an imperative need for discovering valuable knowledge in order to help in decision making process. Big data bring new challenges to data mining and data visualization because large volumes and different varieties must be taken into account. The common methods and tools for data processing and analysis are unable to manage such amounts of data, even if powerful computer clusters are used. To analyse big data, many new data mining and machine learning algorithms as well as technologies have been developed. So, big data do not only yield new data types and storage mechanisms, but also new methods of analysis and visualization. There are many challenges when dealing with big data handling, starting from data capture to data visualization. Regarding the process of data capture, sources of data are heterogeneous, geographically distributed, and unreliable, being susceptible to errors. Current real-world storage solutions such as databases are populated in consequence with inconsistent, incomplete and noisy data. Data quality is very important, especially in enterprise \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m. Data mining techniques are directly affected by data quality. Poor data quality means no relevant results. The cost of devices with sensing capabilities (devices that have at least one sensor, a processing unit and a communication module) has reached the point where deploying a vast number of them is an acceptable option for …\n",

      "Distributed system s have become very useful especially in the case of scientific applications, where there is necessary the processing of a very large data volume, in a very short amount of time, as well as the storage of these data.

      "This paper presents Digua, a standalone library for minifying web resources. It is designed to be used for reducing file sizes of CSS, JavaScript and HTML files. A side-effect of minifying these resources is code obfuscation. The novel approach in our solution is the fact that it can minify all elements of a website, and not just one type of resource. Also, it can detect the correlation between HTML, JavaScript and CSS and perform an all-round minification, therefore saving more bytes. There are no similar solutions available on the market today, technology-wise and functionality-wise. The main challenge is to preserve the code’s functionality. It is hard to ensure that this type of operation will function across an almost infinite variety of websites, but we have taken steps to mitigate these risks through a flexible benchmark system.\n",

      "As nowadays society is a consumer orientated one, choosing which goods to buy is a very common and time consuming activity. Developing an intelligent, social based recommendation system is a good way to overcome the problem of products information overload. Social recommendations for products refers to the fact that consumers trust a product more if there is a review (of any kind) for it, confirmed by many other users (in psychology this is known as Social Proof). Moreover, if the users that confirms it shares common'tastes' with the consumer, not only that he/she will consider the product more reliable, but the'good'will also match his preferences with a high probability and, therefore, he/she will prefer to buy the verified product. A social shopping adviser is what the following paper proposes. We present implementation details, together with experimental results designed to evaluate the system in a first prototype implementation.\n",

      "Many applications (eg, seismic data processing, financial analysis, computational fluid dynamics, complex computation leading to understanding the fundamental nature of matter) create today growing storage infrastructure challenges, as traditional storage \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m struggle to keep pace with their speed and requirements. Modern file \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m such as IBM’s GPFS, SUN’s open source Lustre File System, have been lately developed to support concurrent file and file system accesses across thousands of files \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m [1], addressing in the same time many of the extreme requirements of modern HPC applications [9]. Lustre represents a leading technology in the class of parallel I/O technologies and open source standard for HPC and clusters [10]. Lustre is currently used on nearly 30% of the world’s Top100 fastest computers [5]. In this paper, our analysis targets the Lustre file system. We determine its main characteristics and its suitability to support complex scientific applications. We run benchmarks using different file patterns and sizes for different operations such as read, write, etc., in order to determine file pattern and size for best performance. The results show that the best performance is obtained when the file size or the record length of data written to disk is equal with the processor cache memory, which is expressed as “CPU cache effect”. Also the results show that Lustre delivers increase throughput and I/O by allowing massively parallel file access, in special for stride-read pattern.\n",
      "The necessity of a Large Scale Distributed Data Storage System offering scalability, reliability, performance, availability, affordability and manageability became a strong requirement for high-level application with multiple user interactions. This paper presents the benchmarking for performance of LUSTRE file system and highlights the results obtained from different test scenarios with IOzone and Intel IMB benchmarks, considering parallel I/O characteristics of Lustre file system. The paper also presents a set of best practices for data integrity security and accessibility and a few techniques for troubleshooting with LUSTRE. The results of the benchmark analysis were used to offer a perspective about the performance of NCIT-Cluster at University Politehnica of Bucharest in I/O and MPI jobs.\n",
      "The electronic management of user identities is a requirement for many modern applications. The users identity defines its possible range of actions, and its management becomes critical in applications such as e-Banking, e-Payment, etc. Current solutions are based on methods that use certificate infrastructures, role and policy enforcement management, trust management using social \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ming, etc. We propose a solution for electronic management of identities that provides secure identification of a user using its electronic identity card (eID). The proposed nPA (the new German Identity card) Connector offers a trusted infrastructure for secure handling of electronic identities over the Internet. The nPA connector uses certificates obtained and guaranteed by a trusted Identity Provider. The users personal data from the electronic Identity Card is transmitted from an original source service provider to subsequent destination service providers, all of which have previously signed a contract with the Identity Provider. The connector can be easily integrated within an application, providing a supplementary security layer for identity management. It can also be accessed remote as a Web service. In such cases the connector can be accessed by applications that can communicate with an Identity Provider from a trusted list of eID Service Providers. For that, the connector offers an interface for the application to query attributes from the electronic Identity card. The nPA connector can be considered a service provider between a user wielding a user agent (usually a web application accessed through a web browser) and an Identity Provider.\n",
      "Smartphones today integrate many sensors and provide large computing capacities. They enable the shift towards massive quantities of real-time information becoming access push rather than demand pull on a global case. CAPIM, a platform to support such a paradigm, integrates services to monitor and a context for adapting with the user's context using the sensors and capabilities of smartphones, together with online social data. It integrates context-aware services that are dynamically configurable and use the user's location, identity, preferences, profile, and relations with individuals, as well as capabilities of the \u001b[1m\u001b[31m\u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m devices\u001b[0m to manifest themselves in many different ways and re-invent themselves over and over again. In this paper we present the design and development details of the security and user identification components to support these services. We propose a secure platform for user authentication and session management, based on public key infrastructure (PKI) services. We analyze its strengths and weaknesses, and present as a case study the particular extension of the platform to support secure user access to restricted areas of a building. We also discuss an analysis of the implementation, cost assessments and problems that might arise, as a methodology to support the construction of \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m and context-oriented applications.\n",

      "One of the most challenging problems for taxi companies is to find the closest cabs for their clients. Finding a taxi in current urban scenarios generally means calling to an operational center of a taxi company, provide ones location and maybe, if operator finds an available taxi, client will have a response in proper time. This method has some drawbacks: it is not sure that chosen taxi is the closest available taxi to client and time of arrival is not known for sure. Human factor is very relative and in this case is the main communication link. On the other hand, we learn that computers are safe.

      "This paper is dealing with the performances (Coefficient of Performance, COP and Power) evaluation for a quasi-Carnot irreversible cycle, namely the Irreversible Refrigeration Cycle with Mechanical Compression of Vapour. The present computation scheme is based on recent developments of the Direct Method from Finite Speed Thermodynamics (FST). The Direct Method consists in analyzing any irreversible cycle, step by step, by writing the corresponding equation of the First Law of Thermodynamics for finite speed processes and integrating it on the whole cycle, for each process. The First Law expression for finite speed processes includes three of the main sources of internal irreversibilities, namely: finite speed interaction between the piston and the gas/vapour, friction due to the finite piston speed within the cylinder, throttling processes in the valves. The new expression of the First Law for processes with finite speed is used here in order to get equations that relate the vapour properties for each irreversible process that occurs with finite speed of the piston in the compressor, in a Refrigeration Machine Cycle with Mechanical Compression of Vapour. These equations are used later for calculating entirely analytically the performances of the cycle, as a function of the finite speed of the piston and also as a function of other parameters such as: vapour temperatures and pressures in the evaporator, respectively in the condenser, compression ratio and mass flow rate. Note that the present analysis will differ from the previously reported one [1], because here the real properties of vapour in the cycle will be considered, for the first time in using the …\n",

      "This paper presents the basic concepts and fundamental equations of the Thermodynamics with Finite Speed (TFS) resulted by the systematically study of the thermal reciprocating machine in relation with the piston finite speed and thermal molecular speed measured in the considered thermodynamic system. These concepts are based on the idea that any propagation of the interaction in the thermodynamic \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m of finite dimensions is achieved by finite speeds: (1) - piston speed, (2) - average speed of the gas molecules inside the cylinder. A specific approach (scheme of calculation) for non-equilibrium (irreversible) thermodynamic processes is developed within TFS in order to find the fundamental equations appropriate for Optimizing Efficiency or COP and Power of thermal reciprocating machines. Analytical equations for all 5 irreversible thermodynamic processes in gases (isometric, isothermal, isobaric, adiabatic, polytropic) are deduced by integration of the combined First and Second Laws equation for processes with Finite Speed. This paper is limited to Irreversible Processes with Finite Speed, without taking into account the Friction and Throttling effects. It also notes the main moments in the development of TFS that led to these concepts and fundamental equations.\n",

Recently various opportunistic routing and dissemination algorithms were proposed and evaluated in various scenarios emulating real-world phenomena as close as possible. Such algorithms generally rely on mobility patterns of users and the context of communication. In this we investigate the addition of social data to improve the performance of communication algorithms and data transmission schema. When the routing decision is influenced by the chance of a particular user being able to successfully carry the data to the next hop, we believe that opportunistic communication algorithms could greatly benefit not only from learning the behaviour of users, but also their history of contacts coupled with the online social familiarity patterns between them. We believe users tend to be in contact more with familiar sets of users, with whom they share common interests. We investigate our approach using two real-world traces collected in two different environments. We first investigate our hypothesis using mobility data collected in an indoor academic environment. We then evaluate our assumptions in an outdoor urban scenario. We present an analysis of our findings, highlighting key social and mobility behaviour factors that can influence such opportunistic solutions.

      "Cars with petrol driven internal combustion engines are constant sources for air pollution. As alternative car engines have not yet replaced the petrol-driven engines, road transportation is today still responsible for large emissions of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, and many other organic compounds into the environment. These chemicals produce great damage to our health (eg, respiratory diseases, irritation to the eyes), and to the environment (eg, global warming, acid rains). There is a direct relation between the car’s emissions and its acceleration: an accelerating car will pollute more than a non-speeding car. Imagine a car approaching an intersection with the traffic lights showing green color. The driver can accelerate (hoping that she/he will be able to pass) or not (bring the car to a safe speed, but risking missing the green). In this paper we present an ITS-based system capable of guiding the driver’s decisions with the goal of reducing vehicle emissions. The system considers parameters ranging from the car’s characteristics to human reactions. In this we present results demonstrating the capability of the system to produce decisions that reduce pollution in urban traffic environments.\n",

This alarming growth has affected these \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms and has put its mark on their performance. Some operators might try upgrading the wide area \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms, but in most scenarios, this is not the most cost-effective and optimal solution. These operators would benefit more from intelligent offloading solutions.

Through extensive analysis, we show that the proposed solutions are able to improve certain metrics based on user requirements.\n",

      "The dynamics of isolated-photon plus one-, two- and three-jet production in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV are studied with the ATLAS detector at the LHC using a data set with an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb(-1). Measurements of isolated-photon plus jets cross sections are presented as functions of the photon and jet transverse momenta. The cross sections as functions of the azimuthal angle between the photon and the jets, the azimuthal angle between the jets, the photon-jet invariant mass and the scattering angle in the photon-jet centre-of-mass system are presented. The pattern of QCD radiation around the photon and the leading jet is investigated by measuring jet production in an annular region centred on each object; enhancements are observed around the leading jet with respect to the photon in the directions towards the beams. The experimental measurements are compared to several different theoretical calculations, and overall a good description of the data is found. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.\n",

The performance of the TRT, operating with two different gas mixtures (xenon-based and argon-based) and its dependence on the TRT occupancy is presented. These studies show that the tracking performance of the TRT is similar for the two gas mixtures and that a significant contribution to the particle momentum resolution is made by the TRT up to high particle densities.\n",
      "The Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo observatories recently discovered gravitational waves from a binary neutron star inspiral. A short gamma-ray burst (GRB) that followed the merger of this binary was also recorded by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (Fermi-GBM), and the Anti-Coincidence Shield for the Spectrometer for the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), indicating particle acceleration by the source. The precise location of the event was determined by optical detections of emission following the merger. We searched for high-energy neutrinos from the merger in the GeV-EeV energy range using the Antares, IceCube, and Pierre Auger Observatories. No neutrinos directionally coincident with the source were detected within ?? 500 s around the merger time. Additionally, no MeV neutrino burst signal was detected coincident with the merger. We further carried out an extended search in the direction of the source for high-energy neutrinos within the 14 day period following the merger, but found no evidence of emission. We used these results to probe dissipation mechanisms in relativistic outflows driven by the binary neutron star merger. The non-detection is consistent with model predictions of short GRBs observed at a large off-axis angle. ?? 2017. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.\n",

We then implement and test our dynamic algorithm in the Sim2Car simulator, showing that it is indeed able to reduce congestion in multiple scenarios.\n",

      "Air pollution is responsible for increased morbidity and mortality due to respiratory problems mainly caused by long term exposure. Although the emissions of principal air pollutants are highly regulated, there is a lack of information about the real extent of personal exposure for an accurate health impact assessment. To tackle these challenges, local air pollution measurements and citizen involvement based on the small IoT devices became necessary. The Tel-MonAer platform is based on IoT devices and Edge/Cloud computing technologies and allows the (near) real-time monitoring of Particulate Matter air pollutants considering the complex chemistry and influence of various parameters (i.e. air humidity, wind speed, temperature). The aim of this paper is the assessment of the influence that air humidity has on the PM concentrations measured with IoT devices based on laser beam technologies. The results showed that in order to increase the accuracy of PM concentrations values a threshold value for relative humidity of 80% needs to be considered. When humidity values are below 80%, the PM concentration values are considered valid, while for values over the threshold, a specific correction algorithm needs to be applied. This paper presents the correction algorithm (based on the type of sensor and humidity) and the testing results (an increase of at least 2.5 times of the correlation coefficient between the corrected and reference values). ?? 2020 ASTES Publishers.

      "This paper is dealing with the performances (Coefficient of Performance, COP and Power) evaluation for a quasi-Carnot irreversible cycle, namely the Irreversible Refrigeration Cycle with Mechanical Compression of Vapour. The present computation scheme is based on recent developments of the Direct Method from Finite Speed Thermodynamics (FST). The Direct Method consists in analyzing any irreversible cycle, step by step, by writing the corresponding equation of the First Law of Thermodynamics for finite speed processes and integrating it on the whole cycle, for each process. The First Law expression for finite speed processes includes three of the main sources of internal irreversibilities, namely: finite speed interaction between the piston and the gas/vapour, friction due to the finite piston speed within the cylinder, throttling processes in the valves. The new expression of the First Law for processes with finite speed is used here in order to get equations that relate the vapour properties for each irreversible process that occurs with finite speed of the piston in the compressor, in a Refrigeration Machine Cycle with Mechanical Compression of Vapour. These equations are used later for calculating entirely analytically the performances of the cycle, as a function of the finite speed of the piston and also as a function of other parameters such as: vapour temperatures and pressures in the evaporator, respectively in the condenser, compression ratio and mass flow rate. Note that the present analysis will differ from the previously reported one [1], because here the real properties of vapour in the cycle will be considered, for the first time in using the Direct Method, by using a correction for departure of vapour behaviour from the behaviour of perfect gases. The previous analysis used only the perfect gas properties. Therefore, these results can be used for optimization and design of refrigeration machines and heat pumps.\n",

By employing the two-neutron transfer reaction induced by an O-18 beam on a Ni-64 target, at the sub-Coulomb barrier energy of 39 MeV, all three lowest-excited 0(+) states in 66Ni were populated and their gamma decay was observed by gamma-coincidence technique. The 0(+) states lifetimes were assessed with the plunger method, yielding for the 0(2)(+), 0(3)(+), and 0(4)(+) decay to the 2(1)(+) state the B(E2) values of 4.3, 0.1, and 0.2 Weisskopf units (W.u.), respectively. MCSM calculations correctly predict the existence of all three excited 0(+) states, pointing to the oblate, spherical, and prolate nature of the consecutive excitations. In addition, they account for the hindrance of the E2 decay from the prolate 0(4)(+) to the spherical 2(1)(+) state, although overestimating its value. This result makes 66Ni a unique nuclear system, apart from (236);U-238, in which a retarded. transition from a 0(+) deformed state to a spherical configuration is observed, resembling a shape-isomerlike behavior.\n",
      "The lifetimes of the excited states belonging to the chiral-candidate doublet bands built on the pi h(11/2) circle times vh(11/12)(-1) configuration in La-130 have been measured by applying the Doppler-shift attenuation method and the in-beam fast timing technique. Excited states were populated in the Sb-121(C-12, 3n) reaction at a bombarding energy of 54 MeV. The 7(+) bandhead of the yrast band was identified as an ---isomeric-state-with-a-lifetime-of-tau(7(+)) = 0.38(7) ns Similar reduced transition probabilities B(M1) and B(E2) were found for the states with the same spin in the partner bands. The results revealed an even-odd spin dependence in the B(E2) values, whereas the B (M1) values vary nearly monotonically with increasing spin. The experimental properties of the doublet bands in La-130 are compared with theoretical calculations done in the frame of the two-quasiparticles-plus-triaxial-rotor model. The static chirality is not supported by the obtained data; however, chiral vibrations cannot be excluded.\n",

The results are compared to the predictions of the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model. Different gamma-ray strength functions have been tested against the experimental values. In the case of 150 Eu, in order to reproduce the experimental isomeric population cross sections, various scenarios for unknown branching ratios of certain discrete states have been discussed. The results provide constraints for the optical model parameters dedicated to this insufficiently known area of isotopes. Such cross sections for (p,gamma) reactions at energies below the Coulomb barrier are valuable for p-process nucleosynthesis calculations.\n",

      "The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and other similar protocols send application data from the source to the destination machine inside segments, without foreseeing for any type of control on the transmission or success metrics. These protocols are very convenient for real time transmission. To sustain the increased functionality and features of the connection-oriented protocol, a set of mechanisms is implemented based on some specific fields of the segment header. These mechanisms result in a significant overhead in terms of the increased number of transmitted packets. This may further translate into significant delays, because of the additional number of switching and routing tasks, and eventually, because of more complex communications procedures, such as e.g. transmission window resizing, and of course, acknowledgement and sequence numbers updating.

      "A fast-timing method to determine lifetimes of nuclear states in the sub-nanosecond domain is presented. It is based on in-beam measurements of triple-gamma coincidences in heavy-ion fusion-evaporation reactions, performed with an array of HPGe and LaBr3:Ce detectors. The high-energy resolution HPGe detectors are used to define de-exciting cascades, while the fast LaBr3:Ce detectors are used to determine the decay time spectra of selected levels fed by these cascades. A special method to treat the time information of an array of fast detectors is employed in order to fully use the efficiency of the array. Two measurements are presented to illustrate the method: a re-determination of the known half-life T-1/2 = 0.7 ns of 7/2(+) level in Cd-107 (test experiment), and the ---determination-of-a-half-life-T-1/2 = 0.7 ns of the E-x = 205 keV, J(pi) -- = 7/2(+) level in Cd-107 (test experiment), and the determination of a ---half-life-T-1/2 = 47 ps for the E-x = 367 keV, J(pi) = 3/2(+) state of Tl-199..\n",

      "gamma rays were measured at several angles in both singles and coincidence mode in the Sn-119(alpha, n gamma)Te-122 reaction at 15 MeV on a thick target. Lifetimes of excited states in Te-122 were determined from a Monte Carlo Doppler shift attenuation method (DSAM) analysis of the Doppler broadened lines shapes of gamma rays de-exciting the levels. A comparison of several deduced lifetimes with recent results obtained with the (n, n') reaction allowed us to validate the choice of a parameter used to calculate the contribution of the side feeding times. The ingredients of the DSAM line-shape analysis (stopping power, description of instrumental line shapes, and side feeding evaluation) are presented in some detail. It is concluded that with proper treatment of side feeding, a DSAM line-shape analysis of peaks in singles or coincidence spectra obtained following the (alpha, n gamma) reaction is able to provide rather accurate values for the lifetimes of levels with low and medium spins.\n",

Energies from decay gamma-rays associated with the reaction residues were measured in event-by-event coincidence mode, with the measured time difference information between the pairs of gamma-rays in each event also recorded using the ultra-fast coincidence timing technique. The experiment used the good full-energy peak resolution of the LaBr3:Ce detectors coupled with their excellent timing responses in order to determine the excited state lifetime associated with the lowest lying, cross-shell, I-pi = 4(-) intruder state previously reported in the N=19 isotone P-34.

      "Low-energy isomeric states of Y-86 were populated in the reaction Ge-73 + O-16 at 57MeV and were investigated by means of delayed n gamma and gamma gamma coincidences. A half-life of 70(7) ns was measured for the 5(-) state at 208 keV, yielding an exceptionally small B(M1) value of 2.0(7) x 10(-5) W.u. and a B(E2) value of 0.34((+24)(-13)) W.u. For the other three known isomeric states at 218, 243, and 302 keV, the half-lives extracted from the present experimental data are in very good agreement with previous measurements. Given the newly observed isomeric character of the 5(-) 208 keV state, the re-analysis of earlier experimental data on the 302 keV isomer led to a new spin-parity assignment, 6(+), for this state. In addition, this re-evaluation provided two g-factors, -0.083(3) and +0.63(2), for the 208 and 302 keV states, respectively. The results are discussed in terms of spherical-shell model calculations performed with a truncated space of configurations built on the f(5/2), p(3/2), p(1/2), and g(9/2) valence orbitals.

Experimental results were cor related with bubble size distribution and flow structures. The physical model of Lieppe (1988) was used in order to explain these results. Adsorption of ionic surfactants on the bubble surface generates an electrostatic field equivalent to an electrolyte solution and this field was proved to be important for overall gas hold-up. The dependence of gas hold-up on the superficial gas velocity showed the change of flow structures in bubble columns.\n",

This study provides new insights into the phenomena at the interface of gas-liquid \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m influencing the gas hold-up in viscoelastic polyacrilamide (PAM) solutions. The influence of different parameters on gas hold up (superficial gas velocity, physical and rheological properties of the continuous phase, bubble mean diameter, bubble size distribution) was experimentally studied. The most important parameter proved to be the resistance of the interface due to the fluid elasticity which increased with the concentration of PAM solution.\n",
      "The bubble motion in non-Newtonian fluids plays a major role in many industrial processes. This study provides new insights into the flow of viscoelastic fluids (polyacrilamide solutions) in bubble columns equipped with porous plates, by means of photographic technique. The viscoelasticity of the continuous phase emphasises several system particularities: a central downward flow behind the bubbles (negative wake) which develops an additional pressure in the continuous phase leading to a growth of the volume of bubbles being generated on the porous plate. The swarm of bubbles is deviated by this pressure into a lateral movement toward the column wall, the height of which dependents both on the solution concentration and hydrodynamic conditions. This is the zone in which viscoelasticity of the fluid becomes stronger due to the increasing of the local gas hold-up compared to the overall gas hold-up, affecting the shape of bubbles. Bubbles split after leaving this lateral movement. These phenomena take place in polyacrilamide solutions with concentration exceeding micellar concentration.\n",
      "This study represents an experimental investigation on the bubbles shape in aqueous solutions of polyacrylamide (PAM). PAM solutions were rheologically characterized in both simple shear and elongational flow. The work concentrations were chosen with respect to critical micellar concentration and its importance on the rheological behavior of PAM solutions has been emphasized. Bubble shape is a function of both polymer solution concentration and relaxation time.\n",

The precision of measurements lies between 10 -20%, and improvements to increase it for any of these methods are welcomed. This work presents improvements to liquid height variation method.

      "This paper studies the influence of continuous phase electrical conductivity on overall gas hold-up in a bubble column using air-electrolyte solutions as dispersed system. Experimental results showed the existence of a critical value of electrical conductivity of the continuous phase above which the influence of this parameter on gas hold-up is significant, in transition and heterogeneous regimes only. It was also showed that in homogenous regime the continuous phase electrical conductivity does not have much influence on gas hold-up.

Still, photograhic method is preferred because it supplies more useful information, in general.

An original photographic technique was successfully applied. The results of the experiments, expressed by histograms show that the hydrodinamic conditions and the continuoys phase nature influence BSD. The structure of histograms may be a start for establishing the hydrodynamic tegimes for a two - phase flow system, because they show specific phenomena of these regimes.

Machine vibration and noise component dominates the overall spectrum at a certain frequency, and so the overall level of vibration or noise is a useful parameter for early detection of faults.

Low-spin states in Zn-64 populated in the epsilon/beta(+) decay of Ga-64, produced in the Fe-54(C-12,pn)Ga-64, were studied through off-beam gamma-ray spectroscopy. The decay scheme of Zn-64 is found to be reasonably close to the predictions of the E(5) critical point symmetry. The structure of the excited 0(+) states in Zn-64 and their behavior in the Zn isotopic chain is discussed.\n",

      "The worldwide increasing pace of population leads to the need to prepare health and social care \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m for the elderly. In this context, there are challenges to develop technologies that meet the needs of older adults, to adapt to their cognitive and perceptual decline. The vINCI project develops an integrated and validated Internet of Things (IoT) framework that is able to improve occupational health care by providing monitoring and support to older people. This naturally leads to a better quality of life and an increase in the active aging of system users. This paper presents design considerations for the vINCI monitoring system, features of the technology used, which facilitate the communication, interaction and exploitation of data received from IoT devices. The collected data will be used to build personalized patient monitoring models. vINCI provides a feasible opportunity for older people to independently assess their quality of life and risk factors, as well as to receive direct feedback that would allow them to take appropriate measures to improve their living conditions and prevent unwanted adverse events that may affect their physical and mental health.\n",

At a time when data privacy is extremely important, it is crucial to protect one’s \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m device. In this paper, we propose a new non-intrusive gait recognition based mechanism that can enhance the security of smartphones by rapidly identifying users with a high degree of confidence and securing sensitive data in case of an attack, with a focus on a potential architecture for such an algorithm for the Android environment. The motion sensors on an Android device are used to create a statistical model of a user’s gait, which is later used for identification. Through experimental testing, we prove the capability of our proposed solution by correctly classifying individuals with an accuracy upwards of 90% when tested on data recorded during multiple activities. The experiments, conducted on a low sampling rate and at short time intervals, show the benefits of our solution and highlight the feasibility of an efficient gait recognition mechanism on modern smartphones.</jats:p>\n",
      "An increase in the temperature difference in the evaporator and/or condenser of a refrigeration system or Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), leads in the first case to the increase in the compressor mechanical work consumption and for the ORC, to a decrease in the mechanical work production, accompanied in both cases by the decrease in the heat transfer surfaces. Larger temperature differences in the evaporator or/and condenser lead to an increase in the operating cost of the system but in the same time by reducing the size of the heat transfer surfaces the investment cost decreases. The challenge between the operating cost and the investment one gives the objective function for optimization. For the refrigeration system the objective function to minimize is the total yearly cost of the plant and for the ORC the objective function to minimize will be the unitary cost of the mechanical work produced.\n",
      " 2016 ACM. Cloud computing \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m have become not only popular, but extensively used. They are supported and exploited by both industry and academia. Cloud providers have diversified and so did the software offered by their \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds are now available from single virtual machine use cases, such as a personal server, to specialized high performance or machine learning engines. This popularity has been brought by the low-cost and risk-free feature of renting computing resources instead of buying them, in a large, one-time investment. Furthermore, clouds permit their clients the use of elasticity. Elasticity is the most relevant feature of cloud computing. It refers to the clients' ability to easily change the number of rented resources in a live environment. This permits the entire system to handle differences in load. Most cloud clients serve web applications or services to third parties. In these cases, load differences can be correlated to the number of users for the service and elasticity is used to handle differences in what is called user load. Most of the scientific literature approaches elasticity looking solely at user load. To give a clearer understanding, the majority of cloud frameworks in use today work as follows: they start a number of worker nodes, and tasks are assigned to them for execution. Only when the user load changes, the number of workers is adjusted, if any. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, where the number of workers depends on the actual requirements coming from the different execution steps of an application. We show such an idea can be achieved for several workflows from different fields and that it can bring significant benefits to execution time and cost.\n",

These observables are sensitive to a wide range of QCD phenomena. Some observables, such as the jet mass and opening angle between the two subjets which pass the soft-drop condition, can be described by a high-order (resummed) series in the strong coupling constant alpha(s). Other observables, such as the momentum sharing between the two subjets, are nearly independent of alpha(s). These observables can be constructed using all interacting particles or using only charged particles reconstructed in the inner tracking detectors. Track-based versions of these observables are not collinear safe, but are measured more precisely, and universal nonperturbative functions can absorb the collinear singularities. The unfolded data are directly compared with QCD calculations and hadron-level Monte Carlo simulations. The measurements are performed in different pseudorapidity regions, which are then used to extract quark and gluon jet shapes using the predicted quark and gluon fractions in each region. All of the parton shower and analytical calculations provide an excellent description of the data in most regions of phase space.\n",

Lower limits on the masses of charginos in different simplified models range from 193 to 240 GeV for moderate mass splittings, and extend down to mass splittings of 1.5 to 2.4 GeV at the LEP chargino bounds (92.4 GeV).

The v2 results are also reported as a function of centrality in three different particle pTintervals. The results are reported from minimum-bias events and jet-triggered events, where two jet pT thresholds are used.

The combined observed (expected) limit at 95\\% confidence level on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair production cross-section is 6.9 (10) times the predicted Standard Model cross-section. Limits are also set on the ratio (kappa(lambda)) of the Higgs boson self-coupling to its Standard Model value. This ratio is constrained at 95\\% confidence level in observation (expectation) to -5.0 < kappa(lambda) < 12.0 (-5.8 < kappa(lambda) < 12.0). In addition, limits are set on the production of narrow scalar resonances and spin-2 Kaluza-Klein Randall-Sundrum gravitons. Exclusion regions are also provided in the parameter space of the habemus Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and the Electroweak Singlet Model. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

      "<jats:p>In order to improve the traffic in large cities and to avoid congestion, advanced methods of detecting and predicting vehicle behaviour are needed. Such methods require complex information regarding the number of vehicles on the roads, their positions, directions, etc. One way to obtain this information is by analyzing overhead images collected by satellites or drones, and extracting information from them through intelligent machine learning models. Thus, in this paper we propose and present a one-stage object detection model for finding vehicles in satellite images using the RetinaNet architecture and the Cars Overhead With Context dataset. By analyzing the results obtained by the proposed model, we show that it has a very good vehicle detection accuracy and a very low detection time, which shows that it can be employed to successfully extract data from real-time satellite or drone data.</jats:p>\n",

Simulation results show that the localization stability, accuracy, and convergence given by the proposed DQPSO-DV-HOP algorithm are better than other schemes. High precision positioning algorithm can improve the accuracy of energy consumption monitoring and provide more accurate data for energy saving management.\n",

      "The analysis of emotions is still considered a rather difficult procedure and it is constrained by the limitations related to the languages available for this analysis. The Romanian language is one of the richest and most complex languages with different dialects, regionalisms, archaisms and a powerful and expressive poetic language. Starting from the original vision of the poets, the expressiveness of the Romanian language has given birth to special metaphors that often lose their meaning if one tries to translate them. For this reason, the need arose to develop a lexicon specific to the Romanian language that would allow the analysis of emotions from different poems and to successfully identify the emotions presented by an author through the artistic images created in his work. This paper presents the first steps in the development of a Romanian lexicon based on methodologies employed in other languages, mainly the English language.

      "<jats:p>Recent studies have approached the identification of foliar plant diseases using artificial intelligence, but in these works, classification is achieved using only one side of the leaf. Phytopathology specifies that there are diseases that show similar symptoms on the upper part of the leaf, but different ones on the lower side. An improvement in accuracy can be achieved if the symptoms of both sides of the leaf are considered when classifying plant diseases. In this context, it is necessary to establish whether the captured image represents the leaf on its upper or lower side. From the research conducted using botany books, we can conclude that a useful classification feature is color, because the sun-facing part is greener, while the opposite side is shaded. A second feature is the thickness of the primary and secondary veins. The veins of a leaf are more prominent on the lower side, compared to the upper side. A third feature corresponds to the concave shape of the leaf on its upper part and its convex shape on the lower part.

      "Remarkable progress in the identification of foliar diseases based on plant images has been achieved through the introduction of convolutional neural \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms (CNN), but most studies are based on images taken in laboratory conditions, on a single-color background and in controlled light conditions. In real life, farmers take pictures with many natural disturbances, such as shadows, various background conditions, the presence of multiple plants, pollen, insects. Thus, the algorithms face limitations because of the diversity of conditions. Accuracy can drop from 98% to 99% achieved when test is done on images of the same nature with training dataset, to less than 70% when test is done on field images. In this context, it is necessary to understand what elements in the image contributed to the classification and why they led to a wrong classification. In this study, we begin by classifying diseases with the help of the ResNet convolutional \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m, using a dataset composed of field images representing four foliar diseases of Sunflower (Helianthus). Next, we applied CNN visualization techniques, to explain the prediction for misclassified images. The interpretation methods have highlighted situations in which the classification was done erroneously, using background elements. We also noticed the case of images where we have several leaves and where the prediction was made using random areas of multiple leaves. The advanced stage of the disease, in which the lesions merge, seems to be another misclassification factor. The lack of a set of images diversified enough to contain all the forms of manifestation of a disease, leads also to wrong classifications either due to missing representation of symptoms, or due to images in which the visual symptoms are similar for several diseases. The conclusion of this study based on visualization results, is that a classification done using segmented lesions can lead to an improved accuracy, because many factors leading to a wrong classification, are eliminated in this way.\n",
      "Today, the challenge in healthcare is to create personalised solutions in which existing care technologies can be better adapted to the cognitive and perceptual decline of older people. This paper presents the final digital solution vINCI, validated in the clinical environment by older adults without major health problems with the involvement of professionals in the field (geriatricians, psychologists, medical staff). To clinically validate the results, two multidisciplinary controlled pilots (in Romania and Cyprus) and open call validations (in Romania, Poland, Slovenia, Italy and Ireland) were implemented in controlled settings. This gave older adults across Europe the opportunity to test vINCI technology in real-life use cases, with the results demonstrating the ability of the vINCI ecosystem to provide a maximum level of quality control, automated monitoring and data governance.\n",
      "Feedback mechanisms for academic courses have been widely used to measure students opinions and satisfaction towards different components of a course; concurrently, open-text detailed impressions enable professors to continually improve their course. However, the process of reading through hundreds of student feedback responses across multiple subjects, followed by the extraction of important ideas is very time consuming. In this work, we propose an automated feedback summarizer to extract the main ideas expressed by all students on various components for each course, based on a pipeline integrating state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing techniques. Our method involves the usage of BERT language models to extract keywords for each course, identify relevant contexts for recurring keywords, and cluster similar contexts.

Popularity of a node, another important routing criterion, can be inferred using the betweenness centrality, meaning the number of times the node is on the shortest path between any other two nodes in the social graph.

      "Since uninterrupted connectivity has become such an important part of everyday life, the amount of energy consumed by the various devices used has increased considerably. We propose a way to limit this consumption by employing opportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms, which are mainly composed of \u001b[1m\u001b[31m\u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m devices\u001b[0m that have no need for a static \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m infrastructure.

Therefore, we propose the addition of social data to existing opportunistic routing algorithms.

Most importantly, we show that by adding knowledge such as social links between participants, the performance of the opportunistic \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m can be improved.\n",
      "Pedestrian dynamics are nowadays commonly analyzed by leveraging Wi-Fi signals sent by devices that people carry with them and captured by an infrastructure of Wi-Fi scanners. Emitting such signals is not a feature for devices of only passersby, but also for printers, smart TVs, and other devices that exhibit a stationary behavior over time, which eventually end up affecting pedestrian crowd measurements. In this paper we propose a system that accurately counts nonstationary devices sensed by scanners, separately from stationary devices, using no information other than the Wi-Fi signals captured by each scanner in isolation. As counting involves dealing with privacy-sensitive detections of people's devices, the system discards any data in the clear immediately after sensing, later working on encrypted data that it cannot decrypt in the process. The only information made available in the clear is the intended output, i.e. statistical counts of Wi-Fi devices. Our approach relies on an object, which we call comb, that maintains, under encryption, a representation of the frequency of occurrence of devices over time. Applying this comb on the detections made by a scanner enables the calculation of the separate counts. We implement the system and feed it with data from a large open-air festival, showing that accurate anonymized counting of nonstationary Wi-Fi devices is possible when dealing with real-world detections.\n",
      "The tremendous growth of smart devices in the past few years has brought new computational, storage and \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ming resources at the edge of the Internet. Using the recently-developed Drop Computing paradigm, these devices can be interconnected in an ad-hoc \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m, using said resources beyond local barriers in order to improve the latency and to remove the pressure from the core Internet \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m caused by the intensive usage of a centralized cloud architecture. In order to use the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ming capabilities of the devices registered in a Drop Computing \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m in an optimal manner, multi-path TCP (MPTCP) is the key technology which allows the concurrent usage of all the devices' \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ming interfaces, leading to a smoother reaction to failures, improved latency, and better throughput. Because of the high variety of devices in Drop Computing, some low-end devices can have stripped \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m stacks with many missing features, but the Linux Kernel Library (LKL) or User Mode Linux (UML) implementations are able to offer MPTCP and other features directly in user space.In this paper, we assess the feasibility and analyze the behaviour of TCP and MPTCP in Drop Computing-specific scenarios, using the Linux native \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m stack or the LKL/UML user space \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m stack. We demonstrate that MPTCP can be used successfully over any of them and that the most suitable one should be selected based on the hardware profile of the device used and the target software application. Furthermore, we prove that LKL and UML can be successfully utilised on low-end devices in order to allow them to use all their \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m interfaces and have a better failure handover solution.\n",
      "AbstractBackground Quality of life (QOL) is a complex concept known for being influenced by socio-demographic characteristics, individual needs, perceptions and expectations. The study investigates influences of such heterogeneous variables and aims to identify and describe subgroups of older patients who share similar response patterns for the four domains (physical health, psychological health, social relationships and environment) of World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument, Short Form (WHOQOL-BREF). Methods The sample used included older Romanian patients (N = 60; equal numbers of men and women; mean age was 71.95, SD = 5.98). Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) was conducted to explore quality of life profiles with the four WHOQOL-BREF domains as input variables. Differences between profiles were analysed by MANOVA and ANOVAs as a follow-up. Results The LPA results showed that the three-profile model was the most suitable and supported the existence of three distinct QOL profiles: low and very low (28.3%), moderate (63.3%) and high (8.4%). The relative entropy value was high (0.86), results pointed to a good profile solution and the three profiles differed significantly from one another. Conclusion Our results reveal heterogeneity within the older adult sample and provide meaningful information to better tailor QOL improvement programs to the needs of older patient groups, especially those designed for patients of profiles related to poorer QOL in different domains.\n",
      "The Covid-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the field of education, with the forced move of many activities to online environments.

      "Over the past five years, different organisations have increasingly called for science to become more open and reproducible. They have endorsed a set of data-management principles known as the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. As such, there is a growing trend towards the open availability of research data, as researchers continue to enhance reproducibility by enabling sharing and opening of their findings and datasets. However, there is not yet a standardised way to openly enable access to datasets while keeping control of their final use, potentially obtaining benefits from their utilisation. This paper introduces Smardy, an EU-funded project which is deploying a traceable FAIR-compliant open innovation marketplace for data. Its innovative method for data exchange consists of the use of blockchain for controlling access rights to data, with data models able to grant access according to policies completely kept under the control of the data owner/producer. We also describe how Smardy employs dimensionality reduction techniques to automatically generate FAIRcompliant metadata, statistical fingerprinting to identify derivated datasets, and watermarking to help data owners trace the distribution of multiple copies of a dataset.\n",

      "Obtaining a high accuracy in the classification of plant diseases using digital methods is limited by the diversity of conditions in nature. Previous studies have shown that classification of diseases made with images of lesions caused by diseases is more accurate than a classification made with unprocessed images. This article presents the results obtained when classifying foliar diseases in sunflower using a system composed of a model that automatically segments the leaf lesions, followed by a classification system. The segmentation of the lesions was performed using both Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN. For the classification of diseases based on lesions, the residual neural \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms ResNet50 and ResNet152 were used. The results show that automatic segmentation of the lesions can be successfully achieved in the case of diseases such as Alternaria and rust, in which the lesions are well-outlined. In more than 90% of the images, at least one affected area has been segmented. Segmentation is more difficult to achieve in the cases of diseases such as powdery mildew, in which the entire leaf acquires a whitish color. Diseased areas could not be segmented in 30% of the images. This study concludes that the use of a system composed of a \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m that segments lesions, followed by a \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m that classifies diseases, allows us to both more accurately classify diseases and identify those images for which a precise classification cannot be made.\n",

      "As we enter the much-awaited year 2020, it is essential to understand the impact that the emerging IoT technologies will have across various industrial sectors and throughout the broader society. According to Gartner, there will be over 20 billion connected devices in 2020, while IDC forecasts expect this number to at least double by the year 2025. This increasingly global and autonomous IoT ecosystem has already demonstrated potential in revolutionizing business operations and consumer products. However, for it to remain successful, we will need to learn how IoT connectivity can help produce valuable outcomes across the two pillars of machine-type communications, massive and critical.\n",
      "The articles in this special section focus on the Internet of Things and wireless sensor \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms. The decade-old concept of devising an immersively \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0med computing ecosystem of people and things is currently one of the fastest growing market segments that integrates software, services, connectivity, and devices. In contrast to conventional industrial automation and machine-to-machine operating models, the Internet of Things (IoT) differentiates itself by making humans an integral part of t he overall ecosys tem. Hence, people not only derive the benefits offered by numerous IoT applic ations, but also become active participants by serving a s walking sensor and actuator \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms. In this respect, each physical thing becomes a digital shadow of the person using its services, both in time and in space. This raises many cornerstone questions, some of which include concerns about data collection models, data usability and freshness, and data privacy and ownership, among many others.\n",
      "The OS Strategic Planning and Implementation Guide sets the stage for the EELISA InnoCORE partners to re-think strategic planning and implementation of OS by following a common approach.The document presents a journey to OS adoption building upon a common framework and a dedicated toolbox.Firstly, we lay the foundation for a common methodological approach to understanding OS proficiency. OS scores were computed and used to profile the members of the partnership. Following the findings of the preliminary quantitative analysis, three phases of OS adoption were identified and described: Learning, Support, and Growth phases. Each of the three phases is accompanied by a set of descriptors. OS descriptors are statements that describe organisational behaviours and actions which indicate that the institution concerned has achieved a certain level of proficiency with regard to OS. OS descriptors complement OS scores to allow for a more comprehensive analysis. Consequently, three broad institutional profiles have been created: OS Learners; OS Achievers and OS Experiencers. There are several ways to use the descriptors. Therefore, an OS Journey has been imagined and described as a multi-stage process to help the partners to achieve OS adoption. The stages are chronologically presented; however, each HEI can decide on the path to take and start in the way they deem most appropriate for their context.Together with the OS scores, the descriptors can be used for diagnosis purposes, planning, implementation and reassessment, consistently informing the whole process of boosting organisational OS proficiency.Considering these arguments, the descriptors were integrated into an OS Action Plan (OSAP) Template. The OSAP and the bank of descriptors should be seen as a compass guiding planning, implementation, and assessment, rather than a to-do list. In this view, the partners will use the OSAP Template as a toolbox from which to pick and combine the most relevant elements considering the level of OS implementation and their specific context. For illustrative purposes, the Guide introduces a case study of the use of descriptors and other additional tools. The Guide concludes with a presentation of mutual activities to be further considered.\n",
      "Summary form only given. Assessing the reusability, adaptability, compose-ability and flexibility of software components is more and more of a necessity due to the growing popularity of component based software development (CBSD). Even if there are some metrics defined for the reusability of object-oriented software (OOS), they cannot be used for CBSD because these metrics require analysis of source code. The aim of this paper is to study the adaptability and compose-ability of software components, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We propose metrics and a mathematical model for the above-mentioned characteristics of software components. The interface characterization is the starting point of our evaluation. The adaptability of a component is discussed in conjunction with the complexity of its interface. The compose-ability metric defined for database components is extended for general software components. We also propose a metric for the complexity and adaptability of the problem solved by a component, based on its use cases. The number of alternate flows from the use case narrative is considered as a measurement for the complexity of the problem solved by a component. This was our starting point in developing a set of metrics for evaluating components functionality-wise. The main advantage of defining these metrics is the possibility to measure adaptability, reusability and quality of software components, and therefore to identify the most effective reuse strategy.\n",
      "The limitations \u001b[1m\u001b[31m\u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m devices\u001b[0m have regarding battery life and computational capabilities have modelled \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m applications towards the cloud, but this often causes congestion, low transfer speeds, and a bad user experience. In order to reduce the dependency \u001b[1m\u001b[31m\u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m devices\u001b[0m have on the cloud, \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m collaborative computing algorithms have been proposed, bringing the cloud to the \u001b[1m\u001b[31m\u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m devices\u001b[0m. Thus, this paper proposes Community Clustering, a collaborative \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m computing algorithm focused on topology and routing, based on collaborative computation of tasks in a \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m comprised of devices which are socially connected and in close proximity to one another. Through simulations, we show that Community Clustering devices can potentially limit cloud usage by as much as 67%, with better response times and with moderate effects on battery lifespan.\n",
      "Mobile devices have become a widespread commodity with an increasing number of applications. The resources needed by those applications have also been increasing disproportionately with the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m phones' battery capacity and computation power. The solution for this problem is to offload computation to both neighboring \u001b[1m\u001b[31m\u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m devices\u001b[0m and to remote servers. The Drop Computing paradigm proposes a few ways of implementing such a solution. The objective of this paper is thus to implement the Drop Computing paradigm as an Android framework that can then be used by third-party developers in their applications in order to leverage computation offloading. The experimental results performed on multiple Android devices show that the framework fairs well with computation problems that have small-sized or constant inputs.\n",
      "Pneumonia is a major cause of illness and death among older adults, and hospitalization rates for pneumonia in patients aged 65 and older have been increasing. However, detecting pneumonia automatically is challenging because it requires large amounts of data from many patients, making traditional machine learning solutions impractical in real life, despite the good results they can achieve. To address this issue, our paper focuses on using federated learning, a new method for applying machine learning techniques in a distributed environment while maintaining patients' privacy and reducing communication and storage overhead at the processing servers. We propose a federated learning system that can analyze X-rays of patients with and without pneumonia, present our approach, and demonstrate promising results.\n",
      "Relying on Wi-Fi signals broadcasted by smartphones became the de-facto standard in the domain of pedestrian crowd monitoring. This method got the edge over other traditional means owing to the fact that insights are built upon data which uniquely identifies individuals and, thus, allows highly accurate crowd profiling over time. On the other hand, handling such uniquely identifying data in such a way that it does not expose the sensed individuals to potential privacy infringements proves to be a difficult task. Although several protection techniques were proposed, they yield data which, combined with other external knowledge, can still be used for tracing back to specific individuals. To address this issue, we propose a construction which protects the short-term storage and processing of privacy-sensitive Wi-Fi detections under strong cryptographic guarantees and makes available in the clear, as end results, only statistical counts of crowds. To produce these statistical counts, we make use of homomorphically encrypted Bloom filters as facilitators for oblivious set membership testing under encryption. We implement the system and perform evaluation on both simulated data and a real-world crowd-monitoring dataset, demonstrating that it is feasible to achieve highly accurate statistical counts in a privacy-friendly way.\n",
      "As the fields of machine learning and computer vision are developing, facial recognition \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m are becoming increasingly popular and are slowly being widely used in various fields like security, surveillance and medicine. This paper presents the design and development of a facial recognition solution that works in a distributed context, given that the devices used for capturing the images do not have the ability to train models capable of achieving good enough accuracy on large amounts of data. Thus, a method is presented in which the detection of human faces and the characteristics extraction are done locally based on a pre-trained FaceNet model. These characteristics are sent to a strong processing unit where a global model is trained and then transferred back to the clients, where it can be used for recognition. Through experimental evaluation, we show that our solution is efficient and exhibits high accuracy values.\n",
      "With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), the Cloud Computing (CC) paradigm has started to exhibit several limitations caused by the fact that it is too far away from the tens of billions of devices. Thus, the edge computing paradigm has come to the fore, aiming to move the processing power to the edge of the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m closer to the data sources. Furthermore, the fog computing paradigm comes as an addition, providing Cloud services decentralized at the geographic region level. This trend of migrating from a centralized to a decentralized approach gives way to a new paradigm, Drop Computing (DC), that involves creating opportunistic decentralized ad-hoc social \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms consisting of edge and \u001b[1m\u001b[31m\u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m devices\u001b[0m. The main goal of this paper is to provide a scheduling model for the Drop Computing paradigm, both at the local end device level and at the global ad-hoc \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m level. We implement various scheduling solutions using the proposed model and, through simulations in the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m environment, we analyze their behavior in multiple scenarios to understand the requirements and outcomes of scheduling in DC.\n",
      "Smart spaces are a rapidly emerging concept in technology. They result from the convergence of various novel technologies, such as the Internet of Things, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, which allow for greater levels of automation and control within physical environments. The devices which are connected to the IoT \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m are equipped with sensors to acquire and exchange data. As a result, the IoT has transformed how we live, work, and play. However, the deployment in smart spaces is not always the best due to the issues arising from \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m node positioning. Therefore, we are investigating solutions to this problem with a novel approach which utilises Voronoi diagrams in conjunction with the algorithmic genetic technique. First, the initial positions of the IoT nodes will be determined by simulating a homogeneous Poisson point process in the smart space environment. Then, after dividing the area into the Voronoi cells, the genetic algorithm will optimise the position towards achieving full \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m coverage within the smart space. Experimental results prove the 100% \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m coverage within the specified area.\n",
      "Nowadays, many interesting uses can be found for human mobility data in \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms, ranging from human flow prediction to statistics regarding crowded areas. However, location data are considered sensitive, and many users are naturally reticent to share this information. Nevertheless, federated learning is a collaborative approach that allows consumers to not share their personal data with anyone, but still contribute to machine learning algorithms. Thus, in this paper we look at how various neural \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms may be used to predict human mobility (and, in particular, the next location) using conventional machine learning algorithms like RNN, LSTM, or GRU. Then, we expand the implementation towards federated learning, which is useful in distributed \u001b[1m\u001b[31msystems\u001b[0m where data are collected from the \u001b[1m\u001b[31m\u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m devices\u001b[0m of people. The results of both approaches are reviewed in order to validate the implementation and then to determine how the accuracy of the \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms is altered by the move towards federated learning, and whether it is a justifiable trade off for the increased benefits of data security and privacy, as well as for the applicability in real-life \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0ms.\n",
      "The proliferation of Internet-connected \u001b[1m\u001b[31m\u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m devices\u001b[0m has been a driving force in the evolution of \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m computing. Battery life and computational limitations inherent to these devices have steered \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m applications towards the cloud computing paradigm. However, this shift has exacerbated issues such as data congestion, slow transfer speeds, and subpar user experiences due to the increased volume of data transferred over the Internet. To alleviate the dependence of \u001b[1m\u001b[31m\u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m devices\u001b[0m on the cloud, various alternative \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m technologies and collaborative computing algorithms have been proposed. This paper introduces one such algorithm, entitled Community Clustering, grounded in dynamic short-term \u001b[1m\u001b[31mnetwork\u001b[0m establishment. It serves as an alternative \u001b[1m\u001b[31mmobile\u001b[0m computing solution, emphasizing collaborative task computation across all devices. Tasks are intelligently routed to devices with lower workloads, employing optimal battery-preserving transfer technologies. Within this paper, we present a practical scenario of this algorithm, and, through an empirical evaluation through simulations, we show that collaborative computing can reduce cloud usage by 67%, while still ensuring a satisfactory user experience.\n"
