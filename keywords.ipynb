      "The removal of toxic heavy metal ions such as lead and zinc from industrial and mining wastewaters has been widely studied because their existence in surface and underground water is responsible for several types of health problems caused to animals and human beings. Also, there are some organic compounds, which must be prevented from reaching in drinking water from various sources of pollution. For these reasons in this paper the experiments were conducted to study the ability of activated carbon for removal of Pb (II), Zn (II), C6H6, C6H5-CH3 from water. In addition to the data from the literature showing the actived carbon efficiency for removing of the organic nature pollutants from water, in this article the study is done also on inorganic toxic pollutants (lead and zinc heavy metals) that can exist in water. The removal efficiency of the tested activated carbon used as adsorbent towards the tested pollutants decreased in the following order: COD (benzene, toluene)> Pb (II)> Zn (II).\n",

      "Meat species in processed food products have been gaining an increasing interest mainly due to public health, economic and legal concerns, but also due to religious reasons. In the recent years there was an increasing demand for healthier meat products. Formulation of healthier meat products based on processing strategies is one of the most important current approaches to the development of potential meat-based functional foods. The main objective of the study was to characterize different type of meat and to use that to obtain a meat product-smoked sausage. The physico-chemical analyses highlighted the moisture content (drying-oven at 105 ºC), protein (Kjeldahl method) and fat (Soxhlet method) content and sodium chloride content (Mohr method) of the meat and the final product. Sensory analyses of the samples as well as control sample were evaluated by 17 untrained panellists using a 9 point hedonic scale. Following this study, it was noted an improvement of organoleptic characteristics (texture and appearance) as well as physico-chemical and sensorial properties of the new product compared with the limits stipulated.\n",

It produces an average of 14% higt quality biochar. Hot-air heating system and forced circulation are equipped with two GAZMER 40/150G energetic modules, which are rechargeable, simple, safe, efficient and environmentally friendly. They can gasify chopped or pelletised biomass. To study the microclimate evolution, it was used a complex numerical model for a 200 m2 hothouse for growing vegetables. Simulated experiments were carried out for frosty days and, estimated, for the whole warming period. Each year 13.44 t of biomass are consumed, resulting 1.78 t of biochar which, when introduced in soil, produces a-6.2 t/year negative balance of CO2.\n",

      "Electro-osmosys principle consists of the application of a direct current voltage to an anode-cathode system introduced into soil. The effect of this system consists of the mobilization of water particles from soil and their transport, in a very short period of time, from the anode to cathode. For the tilling machinery the anode may be a disc-knife and the cathode may be the working part (trash board, coulter knife, furrowers, etc). The soil water transported from the anode to cathode, on the tool-soil contact surface, in consequence, will produce a lubrication of an active surface and through this a great decreasing of the friction forces and implicit of the energy needed for displacing the tool through the soil. The energy needed for tilling the soil represents a great part of a total energy consumed for plants crop. When the soil is tilled by pulling or pushing of the tools for farming, a great part of the tilling energy is consumed for defeating the friction forces from the tool-soil contact surfaces. The active surface of the tilling tool may be properly chosen in order to minimize the frictions, respective the mechanic energies needed for tilling.\n",
      "see more details of oleaginous materials in oil industry. These presses have the following advantages: continuously working, high working capacity, operate without major shocks and vibrations, easy adjustment of the working pressures, etc. Available theoretical elements of functional and power calculus for these machines are quite limited, relying mainly on simple formulas containing some correction coefficients whom values are empirically obtained, from experiments. Processes and phenomena that occur during the pressing process of the oleaginous materials are very complex. This paper contains a theoretical model regarding the power necessary to operate an oil press. The necessary components to power the press are: the power needed to transport the material along the pressing chamber, the power required to press the oleaginous material, the power needed to overcome the friction between the screw spire and the material, the power needed to push the material from the press through the exhaust cylinder head. In this paper there are presented diagrams that show the influence of various constructive and functional parameters on the pressing process.\n",
      "Active bodies of \u001b[1m\u001b[31msoil tillage machines\u001b[0m are the most stressed parts and they wear during soil tillage, due to friction with the soil and to the resistance which they encounter while moving through the soil. Among the active bodies, coulters wear the most, which is why solutions were sought to easily change them, to increase their durability, for auto-sharpening, etc. This paper presents the behavior of the coulters of a classic plough, hardened by various methods, compared to a standard coulter, non-hardened. The results were obtained by plowing several hundreds of hectares, on the same type of soil, with an plough on which the coulters were mounted. The wear level was determined by weighing the plough share at the beginning of work and when demounting it, after having reached the maximal wear (it could not been used anymore).\n",
      "The shock absorbers role in all the auto vehicle geometry is very important, because the shock absorber is a key element for the security and performances of a technical equipment. The main function of a shock absorber consist of controlling the ratio between the technical equipments static masses (chassis, casing, engine, passengers, payload, etc) and the moving ones (wheels, tyres, brakes, etc) during its functioning. In movement, these masses produce continuum mechanical shocks, because of the terrain irregularities or the direction changes, which are transmitted to the rolling system, passengers, direction, etc. The tests which have to be effectuated on a shock absorber are of static and dynamic nature. The shock absorbers compact testing platform–PCIA can be used for performing both types of tests which lend to using such an equipment. The platform offers the possibility of simultaneous endurance dynamic testing of more shock absorbers, thus reducing both the time and cost of a test and it could be used in the future for testing other machine organs. Likewise can be effectuated static resistance tests of shock absorbers as also the dynamic test of raising the elastic characteristics. The equipment can reproduce different reference signals for actuating the shock absorbers, under different forms and with different frequencies and amplitudes, thus reproducing the entire range of vibrations and loads at which the shock absorbers are subjected by daily usage as also the solicitations at which they have to be subjected for testing, stipulated in standards and other regulations.\n",
      "Energy efficiency is nowadays a key factor in designing industrial machinery, where digital technologies, modeling and simulation software environments are beginning to have a deeper impact. Smart technologies have entered industrial field supporting machine design engineers to develop and optimize their technical solutions. In some cases, when energy efficiency of old machinery needs to be increased, retrofitting existing schematics is not always an easy task, instead of modifying the connections between components or replacing some of the existing components with new ones it is preferred to replace old and inefficient parts with new modular solutions. Hydraulics and pneumatics are still two types of industrial drives that are used widely, but their overall energy efficiency has not improved very much in the past years. There are conducted industrial researches having good laboratory results, but these solutions are not ready yet for the market–standardized equipment and modules being preferred.

      "Environmental protection is one of the leading factors when designing modern industrial machinery, their increased overall energy efficiency requiring the use of new industrial design concepts, smart driving circuits and digital concepts [1]. Classic industrial machinery is supposed to be changing in the next few years due to the development of INDUSTRY 4.0 concept for manufacturing technologies [1]. Improving energy efficiency, in most of the cases implies designing new driving schematics and their complexity seems to be significantly increasing. Rapid development of electronics technology and software industry supported the need for energy efficiency, but fluidic–hydraulic and pneumatic–installations are performing not so well on this field. There are known various constructive solutions for directional valves that traditional fluidic manufacturers promote, in order to improve overall energy efficiency [2], but those solutions are centered on specific industrial application of group of applications. In a narrower case, a \u001b[1m\u001b[31mhydraulic PET waste\u001b[0m baling press must be optimized taking into consideration productivity, ease-of-use, flexibility, energy efficiency and reduced maintenance costs [3].

      "In the energy efficiency era, modern industry machinery demand now more than ever intelligent and efficient electronic control modules, in order to gradually increase their technical performances. Classic hydraulic driven machinery are complex and reliable but trying to reconfigure their schematic is a very hard to do process, in some cases impossible. Machine flexibility and energy efficiency are probably two of the most important concepts that govern the world of equipment–installation–machine design engineers. Solving this sort of demands certainly leads to a rapid increase in electronic control system complexity and designing new electro-hydraulic equipment that use modern concepts such as digital hydraulics.

      "Nanotechnology offer through the semiconductor nanomaterials used in photocatalysis process an alternative way for removing organic pollutants from wastewater having the potential of replacing the traditional wastewater technologies. The principle of photocatalysis is the mineralization of organic compounds up to CO2 and H2O, under the action of photon energy equal to or greater than the band gap of the semiconductor nanomaterial. The organic pollutants are degraded by a number of oxidation/reduction reactions initiated by the dissolved oxygen from aqueous solution, which generate superoxide ion (O2.-) or hydroperoxyl radicals (HO2.). TiO2 represents the most popular photocatalytic material used for the removal of pollutants in wastewater treatment under UV light. The advantages which recommend the titanium dioxide as the most popular may be mentioned: low cost, non-toxicity and high photocatalytic activity. A large range of organic pollutants can be removed using photocatalysis, such as: pesticides, herbicides and others. For sustain this goal we have chosen to test titanium dioxide (TiO2) in the photocatalysis process for methylene blue and diclofenac removal from the water.\n",

The extraction of oil from seeds or plant parts, is accomplished by mechanical pressing, sometimes followed by chemical extraction, because the mechanical pressing alone does not remove all the oil from the seed. Optimization of mechanical oil presses exploitation involves adjusting the constructive and functional parameters, so that power consumption for compression to be minimal and the degree of separation of oil to be larger, in terms of processing capacity (productivity) as large as possible.

The consequences of the dependence of the soil draft tillage force by the working speed, as well as the effect and acceptance of purely static terms, are investigated. Methods are given to modify the static terms in the equation of motion of the aggregate. The problem refers especially to the terms related to friction and to those that give the force of resistance to soil deformation. These component terms of the tensile strength can give various paradoxical interpretations, which are not found in experimental research, which is why various alternative forms are proposed for their remodelling. The proposed new forms lead to solutions of the equations of moving closer to reality, first of all, in the stages of transition, starting from repose and braking until repose. Two ways of correcting the expressions of tensile strength forces are exploited: the introduction of test-type operators, respectively the proposal of models of tensile strength forces that depend on a positive power, not necessarily the whole, of the travel speed. The consequences of these functions on the working regime of the aggregate are studied, and also on the numerical apparatus involved in solving the dynamic problem.

The qualitative indices to which the results presented in this chapter refer are the dimensions of the cross-section and the length of the irrigation channel compartment. Qualitative indices are studied for four variants of secondary organ formation, the palette. A statistical method for selecting the best pallet variant is presented, relative to the experimental conditions. The working method developed for the selection of the optimal palette variant can be used in a future experimental study for various types of soils, with various humidity and different working speeds. The mode of experimentation is briefly explained. A statistical analysis of the experimental data is made. The statistical analysis contains both a descriptive and an inferential part on the experimental data population consisting of the dimensions of the irrigation channel opened by the equipment used. The experimental data come from two variants of equipment for opening channels, each operating in turn with four types of blades for rectifying the open channel through rarity. Finally, based on objective functions developed by the authors, optimal solutions to the working process of this equipment are obtained.

The different agro-pellets obtained from the recipes were burnt in a specialized pellet thermal power station (fueled by pellets) where they were used for heating a 300m2 house, monitoring the resulting gases evacuated through the chimney: CO, NOx and SO2. The last measurement was made on a fir pellet sample, purchased from the market, in order to make a comparison and to outline how agro-pellets behave differently to the average market pellet. Results have shown lower emission concentrations of agro-pellets in comparison to average pellets, but in the case of CO emission, they topped the intervention threshold.\n",

      "<jats:p>Water is the primary limiting factor in dryland crop production, therefore emerging approaches for preserving rainwater to be more accessible to plants, for extended periods of time, can significantly improve agricultural system efficiency. Furrow diking, a method involving compartmentalizing micro-basins to increase infiltration and soil water storage is one of the most promising water conservation solutions, particularly for sloping terrain. Moreover, furrow diking is associated with water conservation practices and regenerative agriculture as adaptive to dryland crop production. The present research study aims at improving the process of building soil compartmentalized segments using furrow diking technology, by designing and testing optimal geometries for the active soil modeling component. Three new constructive designs of a furrow diking active subassembly were built and tested in comparison with the standard version. In accordance with the considered quality indicators, the most efficient constructive shape was the curved rotor blade due to the higher volume of managed soil and fewer soil losses. Furthermore, the technology applied on three non-irrigated sunflower experimental crops grown on sloping land showed very good effectiveness with respect to the studied climatic and pedological conditions in southern Romania. When compared with non-compartmentalized crops, the most efficient rotor geometry design increased seed production by 11–13%. Water storage efficiency contributed the most to the yield increase, with moisture retention from the root zone improving by an average of 20%.</jats:p>\n",
      "The current trend is to maximize the potential of limited resources and find alternative materials to integrate into circulating economy. The wine industry remains one of the most important industries in the agricultural and food sector. Therefore, much research has focused on the reuse of marc and the extraction of beneficial elements and their reuse in new products. Once this purpose is created, the problem is to use a method and technology to separate grape seeds from most impurities. Given the above premise, in this paper, we have identified the problems that have arisen in the process of separating grape seeds from pomace and we have proposed a methodology for conditioning them. Going through the proposed methodology, the degree of cleaning of the seeds is improved by aprox. 10%, which leads to a superior quality of the oil from the seed oil and an improvement in the amount of oil extracted. In the first stage of the paper, we established the methodology for conditioning the grape seeds based on an analysis of the initial sample of the white Sauvignon marc and the red Feteasca neagra variety. The main problems that prevent the separation of the seeds as easily as possible appear as a result of the grape squeezing process, because first of all the lumps of the marc are formed, and secondly a significant part of the seeds is stuck in the grape skin. We collected an initial sample of the marc and then we classified and weighed the impurities and determined the amount of grape seeds in the sample. After the completion of the seed conditioning stages, we analysed the amount of residue collected from each stage and we finally obtained a separation yield of 13% for Sauvignon pomace and 19% for Feteasca Neagra.\n",
      "Mechanical continuous presses are the most commonly used machines for the pressing of oleaginous materials in oil industry. These presses have the following advantages: continuously working, high working capacity, operate without major shocks and vibrations, easy adjustment of the working pressures, etc. Available theoretical elements of functional and power calculus  for these machines are quite limited, relying mainly on simple formulas containing some correction coefficients whom values are empirically obtained, from experiments. Processes and phenomena that occur during the pressing process of the oleaginous materials are very complex. This paper contains a theoretical model regarding the power necessary to operate an oil press. The necessary components to power the press are: the power needed to transport the material along the pressing chamber, the power required to press the oleaginous material, the power needed to overcome the friction between the screw spire and the material, the power needed to push the material from the press through the exhaust cylinder head. In this paper there are presented diagrams that show the influence of various constructive and functional parameters on the pressing process.\n",

      "<jats:p>Lavender is among the medicinal and aromatic plants with high economic value in the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and aromatherapeutic industries, and in its composition has numerous compounds, such as tannins, anthocyanins, minerals, saponins, flavonoids, polyphenols, essential oil and others. The qualitative and quantitative characteristics of lavender are best highlighted by extraction techniques such as hydrodistillation, steam distillation and supercritical CO2 extraction. In the water distillation extraction method, the plants are soaked in water until boiling and steam is released, carrying the essential oils with it, which are then separated via cooling. Steam distillation is one of the most common methods used to extract essential oils from medicinal and aromatic plants. Unlike hydrodistillation, where the water is stored directly in a tank, in this method, the steam is transported into the tank from the outside and the oils are released from the plant components when the steam penetrates the structures that contain it. Essential oils contain essential compounds that have antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-fungal, etc., properties.

Typical carrier fluids include hydrocarbons, water, fluorocarbons, esters, diesters, organometallics, polyphenyl ethers and silicones. Surfactants such as oleic acid and other small molecules as well as a few polymers have been used to coat the surface of microcrystalline Fe3O4 to help prevent particle flocculation. It is of considerable interest, thus, to develop better synthetic approaches for ferrofluids, particularly since their unusual magnetic properties are finding applications in loudspeakers, zero-leakage seals, damping liquids, non-wearing electrical switches, artificial muscles, magnetic inks, environmental protection and energy converters.

      "The annually necessary human bone grafts are in continuous grown due to the increasing of fractals, congenital and non-congenital diseases. Based on statistical reports (Murugan and Ramakrishna 2005), only in USA about 6.3 million fractures occur every year and about 550.000 of these require bone grafting. The most frequently fractures occur at the level of hip, ankle, tibia and fibula. Due to the higher physical effort, the men are more exposed to fracture than women (2.8% in the case of men comparing to 2.0% in the case of women). The number of fractures increases year by year and consequently many researchers from different research fields co-operate in order to develop new bone graft materials. Also, it is important to mention that, in the present, the bone diseases are overlapped only by hearth diseases. The history of bone grafting is starting in 1913 when Dr. DE Robertson assays a piece of cat’s bone and a piece of human bone for bone grafting into dogs (Gallie and Toronto 1914).

It is generally accepted that the discovery of antibiotics was of great importance but, nowadays new antimicrobial agents are needed and/or their better administration routes. The limitation of the use of antibiotics is essential because of the following reasons: the excessive use of antibiotics leads to the development of antibiotic resistant microorganisms; there are some alternatives for many types of infections, many of these alternatives being less toxic and do not lead to antibiotic similar resistance. In compliance with the above presented, the use of antibiotic is recommended to be eliminated (when alternatives are available) or to be reduced by using combined therapy when possible or to administrate these drugs through targeted or loco-regional drug delivery systems.\n",

The presence of sulfanilamide assures antimicrobial activity while alginate and magnetite are responsible with the slow release kinetic. The presence of magnetite is also important because allows magnetic field guidance of the alginate/Fe3O4/sulfanilamide beads. The obtained DDS were characterized by FTIR, SEM, release profile in saline solution (0.9% NaCl), and antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli.\n",
      "The development of new oral insulin delivery systems could bring significant benefits to insulin-dependent patients due to the simplicity of the method, avoidance of pain caused by parenteral administration and maintenance of optimal therapeutic levels for a longer period. However, administration of such therapeutic proteins orally remains a challenge because insulin (Ins) is a very sensitive molecule and can be easily degraded under the existing pH conditions in the stomach and intestines. Moreover, due to the large size of insulin, intestinal epithelium permeability is very low. This could be improved by immobilizing insulin in the mesoporous silica pores (MSN), acting as a shield to protect the molecule integrity from the proteolytic degradation existing in the stomach and upper part of the small intestine. Due to the high adsorption capacity of insulin, biocompatibility, ease of functionalization with various organic …\n",

      "This chapter is devoted to the advances in the field of nanoparticles-mediated cancer treatment. A special attention is devoted to the use of magnetite and silver nanoparticles. The synthesis and properties of Fe3O4 and Ag nanoparticles as contrast or antitumoral agents as monolith or component of more complex systems such as polymer matrix composite materials based on: polymers (chitosan, collagen, polyethylene glycol, polyacrylates, and polymethacrylates, polylactic acid, etc.) and various antitumoral agents (cytostatics, natural agents and even nanoparticles-magnetite, silver, or gold) are discussed. Special attention is paid for the benefits and risks of using silver and magnetite nanoparticles. In both cases, the discussion focuses on aspects related to diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The influence of size and shape [1-3] is important from the materials characteristics as well as from the biological points of view. The role of magnetite is also analyzed from the point of view of its influence on the delivery of different components of interests (antitumoral components, analgesics/anti-inflammatory agents, etc.).

      "<jats:p>We report a facile method to synthesize magnetite nanoparticles with mesoporous structure by coprecipitation method using different stabilizing agents like salicylic acid, glutamic acid, and trichloroacetic acid. The stabilizing agents were used to prevent the aggregation of the magnetite nanocrystals and to obtain stable nanostructures even in the biological environment. The structure and morphology of magnetic nanocrystals were determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, infrared (IR) spectra, scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The results reveal important differences between these magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), which are mainly attributed to the stabilizing agents. The smallest nanoparticles were obtained in the presence of trichloroacetate ions. The mechanism of formation of these suprastructures is strongly correlated with the end functional groups of the stabilizing agent. Thus, the obtained nanoparticles are potential candidates for contrast agents as well as targeted carrier for specific diseases, especially cancer.</jats:p>\n",

The MCM-41 and MCM-41/Fe3O4 mesoporous silica NPs were characterized using specific physico-chemical methods [transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption and desorption studies BET (Brunauer Emmett Teller) method, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy], while the release studies were done by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-modified method. The pH dependence of the delivery of folic acid from the mesoporous structures was analyzed and found that the release is pH sensitive. The lower delivery at strongly acid pH comparing with neutral/slightly alkaline pH could be beneficial because in stomach the folic acid can be destroyed.\n",

The integrity of collagen was studied by FTIR, comparing the COLL/HA composite spectrum of the sample obtained by ultrasonication with that of the control sample (no ultrasonication was applied). Due to no changes observed at the CO region and due to the unaltered ratio between the peaks intensity (between the intensities of the peaks from 1450 and respectively 1240cm-1) of the two composite materials it can be asserted that ultrasonication does not alter the structure of collagen.

      "Stents are important medical devices used to increase the quality and life expectancy of patients with heart diseases and stroke, leading causes of death, worldwide. In order to minimize the risk of restenosis, different coating on bare metal stents (BMS) such as polymer coatings; titanium dioxide, titanium nitride or titanium oxynitride coatings; carbon coatings and others are used. The aim of this work was to develop novel stents coated with titanium oxynitride (TiOxNy) with optimal chemical, mechanical and biological properties having possibly good coverage rate of inner and outer stent surfaces. The improvement should be achieved by optimization and development of a magnetron sputtering deposition technology. The goal of the study is understanding of the existing potential for improvement of the deposition technology and the coating quality itself. For this study, different O-2/N-2 ratios, meaning 1/2, 1/5 and 1/10 (the ratios of reagent gasses are given for the values of mass flows into the chamber) has been selected. Stability in simulated body fluids, surface morphology and protein adsorption as well as preliminary cytotoxic behaviour of the samples on HUVEC cells has been analysed. SEM experiments have shown the potential in the improvement of coating-stent adhesion by all samples. TiOxNy 1:5 samples were found to have the lowest adsorption, the smoothest surface morphology and the smallest rate of salt deposition from simulated body fluids (SBFs). This kind of surface has been recommended for further optimization and application.\n",

So, themulticomponent approach can be the most suitable way to assure the multifunctionality of these nanostructuresto achieve the desired/necessary properties. The in vivo stability is mostly assured by the coating of the magneticcore with various polymers (including polyethylene glycol, silica etc.), while the targeting capacity is mostlyassured by the decoration of these nanostructures with folic acid. Unfortunately, there are also some limitationsrelated to the multilayered approach. For instance, the increasing of the thickness of layers leads to a decreasethe magnetic properties, (hyperthermia and guiding ability in the magnetic field, for instance), the outershell should contain the targeting molecules (as well as the agents helping the internalization into the cancercells), etc.</jats:p></jats:sec>\n",

In addition to the possibility of synthesizing a wide range of hydrogels from various natural and synthetic polymers, they are suitable for scaffold production. Moreover, they can have antimicrobial, antitumor and analgesic functions due to their intrinsic properties or through addition of proper biologically active agents.

The two-dimensional (2D) sheets were obtained by electrospinning technique, with the aim to produce multifunctional wound dressing with regenerative and even anti-infective roles. The most important advantages of the electrospinning technique are related to the possibility of obtaining fibers with controlled morphology, usually having high specific surface and water and air penetration and the possibility of functionalizing these fibers and nets depending on the desired application. These advantages make it possible to use electrospinning for a wide range of biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering, controlled release, implantology, wound healing, and more.

Titanium dioxide precursor represented by titanium isopropoxide was introduced in mesoporous silica pores under vacuum, followed by hydrolysis. Synthesized powders were morphologically characterized by (SEM and HRTEM) and compositionally by (FTIR, EDAX, elemental analysis, XRD). The obtained results confirm the synthesis of MCM-41 mesoporous silica with hexagonal pores loaded with TiO2 nanoparticles. Synthesized powders were subsequently used in studies of azoic dye (tartrazine) adsorption/removal from aqueous solutions. Adsorption studies were carried out on a UV-VIS spectrophotometer at 427 nm.

      "Simulated body fluid (SBF) immersion technique is an attractive method for biomaterial synthesis due to the conditions similar to the in vivo synthesis ones. The collagen/hydroxyapatite (COLL/HA) composite biomaterials obtained by immersing the collagen matrices in SBF are usually well mimicking the bone, especially the mineral phase synthesis and properties. Starting from these hypotheses, we have achieved the mineralization of human nasal septum cartilage by SBF immersion technique. For this, nasal septum cartilages were collected from a 33 years old woman and used as obtained. The mineralization was conducted by immersion for 168 hours at ~37??C and pH=7.4. The cartilage mineralization process by SBF immersion can be compared with the endochondral ossification occurring naturally. When compared with other related materials, the obtained materials have shown better characteristics because the organic phase had been synthesized by the human body and, the mineral phase was deposited by a biomimetic method. Summarizing, the proposed method can be considered an advanced biomimetic method and the obtained materials can be expected to exhibit improved properties.\n",
      "Protecting the environment by reducing PET waste has become a global priority. Recycling is considered one of the simplest and most environmentally friendly ways to reduce PET waste. However, during recycling, PET undergoes thermal/hydrolytic degradation, which leads to reduced molecular weights and low physical, mechanical, chemical, etc. properties. Thus, in order to prevent the degradation processes and to improve the mechanical and processing properties, various blends based on PETr/HDPE (60: 40 mass ratio) will be processed on a Brabender mixer in the presence/absence of the compatibilizers, EVA and PE-g-AM. The diagrams of torque versus time, recorded during processing demonstrate that PETr suffers degradation processes, which leads to a decrease in torque due to reduced viscosity/molecular weight and reduced physical-mechanical and processing properties. Instead, with the addition of EVA or PE-g-AM, in varying amounts, degradation processes are largely avoided. These observations are also supported by the values obtained from the Izod impact resistance tests, namely the higher the amount of compatibilizer, the higher the shock resistance due to the higher phase adhesion. The hardness of the blends progressively decreases, relative to the PETr control sample value, from 83 to at least 61 Sh D for the compatibilized blends. FTIR microscopy, performed on the obtained samples, shows higher homogeneity between PETr/HDPE if the addition of EVA or PE-g-AM is higher (20%). Melt flow index is improved for compatibilized blends compared to PETr and PETr/HDPE.\n",

      "The printability of hydroxyapatite/collagen mixture depends highly on the ratio between the two components and the printing temperature, and on the pH of the final printing additive. During the printing process, the vital parameters are the printing speed and the printing temperature. The adherence of the printed material to the surface is also an issue, highly defining the shape of the printed surface. In this paper we obtained a set of optimised printing parameters, printing speed, printing temperature and a composition of the printing mixture, the optimum printing speed being in the 30-50 mm/s interval, the optimum temperature between 0-10 C. In the case of this particular printing mixture, we also found that the rheological properties can be improved by the addition of low viscosity oil content. Due to this aspect, we opted for a volatile oil with antibacterial properties, thus obtaining a dual benefit, that of regenerative purpose material combined with anti-inflamatory or/and antimicrobial benefits. The material’s morphology was tested using SEM (scanning electron microscopy), FT-IR microscopy and optical microscopy. The microscopy results confirm the surface homogeneity of the scaffold resulted through 3D printing, the homogeneity of the scaffold being an important requirement for medical applications.

The advantage of COLL/HA/drug system comes from the regenerative role induced by the support materials (COLL/HA) as well as the curative activity induced by the delivery of the biological active agent. In this study the synthesis and characterization of collagen/hydroxyapatite drug delivery systems (COLL/HA/active agent–COLL/HA-AAg) is presented. Four active components were used: acetylsalicylic acid, salicylic acid, acetaminophen and niflumic acid in order to use them in pain or inflammation management. The purpose of the use of these active agents is derived from the high risk of inflammation and pain that occurs upon the surgical intervention. Hydroxyapatite was obtained by precipitation using Ca (OH) 2 and NaH2PO4 as precursors. By short, the COLL/HA composite material was obtained by the two steps mineralization process [1]. In the first step, calcium hydroxide is added to the collagen gel and allowed to interact for 24h. In the second step, the sodium dihydrogen phosphate solution is added to the above presented reaction mass leading to the precipitation of hydroxyapatite.

      "Titanium dioxide is extensively used for medical and industrial applications including drug delivery, tissue engineering, white pigment, antimicrobial agent, biological active coatings, etc. Based on the literature data, the photocatalytic properties of the TiO2 are strongly dependent on nature and concentration of dopant agents, on morphology and especially size, crystallographic form and so on. TiO2 is also extensively used for developing functional coatings because of the synergism of the surface properties and photocatalytic properties–which induce antimicrobial activity. Even if TiO2 is increasingly used in many applications only limited data are available relating to the modification of TiO2 in order to design it for coating. When titanium dioxide is designed as coating material additional properties are necessary: adhesion on the surface, flexibility, etc. These new characteristics can be easily obtained by modifying the TiO2 by partial substitution of oxygen with nitrogen. Based on the literature data, the content of nitrogen can be between 4 and 70% with minimal alteration of the desired properties (including biocompatibility).

      "Layer by layer (LbL) deposition is a useful method for deposition of many inorganic (including metals, oxides and phosphates) and organic (including polymers and proteins) components on a large range of substrates. The LbL deposition of hydroxyapatite (HA) onto a collagen matrix involves HA synthesis on the collagen matrix starting from electrically charged precursors such as Ca2+ and PO43− at a proper pH to precipitate the desired calcium phosphate. The LbL deposition process was continuously monitored in order to study the amount of HA deposited in each layer. The deposition of the first layers of HA was concluded to be highly influenced by the collagen matrix. When the collagen matrix is crosslinked with glutaraldehyde, the matrix structure is not modified during the deposition, and the porosity will decrease with the number of layers until saturation is reached. Following pore saturation, HA will be only …\n",

The composites were obtained by the co-precipitation method starting from collagen gel and hydroxyapatite precursor. The mineralized collagen gel was introduced in an electric field for 1 h, frozen and lyophilized. In order to study the orientation process parameters, two types of electric fields were tested: pulsatory and superposed (both direct and pulsatory).

      "In drug therapy, it is important to provide therapeutic levels of drug to the site of action (or at least in the blood) and maintain them during the treatment [1]. Furthermore, it is desirable to minimize temporal variations in drug concentration by using modified drug delivery systems (MDDS) to avoid periods of over-dosing or under-dosing. The modifications involve changes in the rate and/or time and/or site of drug release in comparison with conventional formulations by delaying drug release (extended release systems), targeting drug release (site-specific release systems), prevention or reduction of side effects, taste masking or improving drug solubility. New strategies are focused on increasing drug stability and on simultaneously modifying drug delivery patterns (particulate delivery systems)[2]. These changes are achievable by several possible mechanisms, including modifications in pharmaceutical formulations and/or method of preparation. Clay minerals (layered silicates) have been proposed as fundamental constituents of several MDDS, with different purposes and acting through various mechanisms [3]. The intercalation of organic species into layered inorganic materials provides a useful and convenient route to prepare organic-inorganic hybrids that combine the properties of both inorganic host and organic guest [4, 5]. A very interesting possibility is to use clay mineral polymer composites to modify drug release. Although clay minerals and polymers are frequently used as single drug carriers, this type of drug delivery system (DDS) often does not meet all requirements. Preparation of polymer layered silicate composite offers the possibility of …\n",

      "The use of methacrylic acid (MAA) in medicine was poorly investigated in the past but can be of great importance because the incorporation of hydroxyapatite (HA) can lead to new composite materials with good properties due to the strong electrostatic interactions between carboxylate groups of polymer and Ca2+ ions from HA. The scope of this study was to determine the potential of using composite materials based on poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) and hydroxyapatite in dentistry. Two routes of synthesis were taken into account: i) HA was synthesised in situ and ii) commercial HA was used. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction were used for compositional assessments. Scanning electron microscopy was performed to determine the morphology and differential thermal analysis (DTA) coupled with thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was used to study the thermal behaviour and to observe quantitative changes.

The obtained composite materials were characterize by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy detector (EDS) and complex thermal analysis. The main differences between the composites obtained by different immersion times can be visualized by SEM images. The increasing immersion time lead to a more compact composite material, with lower porosity as exhibited in the recorded SEM images. On the other hand, not only the morphology is changed but also the composition of the composites. At high immersion time, onto the composite materials, sodium chloride (NaCl) crystals can be observed. The presence of NaCl can be easily identified by XRD and, based on the relative characteristic peaks intensity can be quantified.\n",

Nanomaterials are also called “a wonder of modern medicine”[1]. The past years, it has been discovered that the metal oxide nanomaterials are among the most studied products because of their wide applications such catalysis, sensors, environmental remediation, medicine, varistors, solar cells, rubber, concrete, foods, cosmetics and personal care products [2], but they have been studied also because of their exclusive antimicrobial, wound healing and anti-inflammatory properties [1].

The intermediate and final nanoparticles are water dispersible due to the polar organic shell. The purpose of the silver secondary shell is to reduce the consumption of silver and other noble metals for the synthesis of similar nanoparticles. Para-aminobenzoic acid was chosen as a shell due to the fact that it provides a good water dispersability of the final nanoparticles.

The paper describes the obtaining process of the composite and the evaluation of its characteristics. Polyamide 6 was used as thermoplastic matrix in form of extruded plates, and it was reinforced with two layers of carbon fiber plain weave fabric. The assembly was pressed at high temperature in order to obtain a laminated structure material.

      "Synthesis of biomimetic materials for implants and prostheses is a hot topic in nanobiotechnology strategies. Today the major approach of orthopaedic implants in hard tissue engineering is represented by titanium implants. A comparative study of hybrid thin coatings deposition was performed by spin coating and matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE) onto titanium substrates. The Collagen-calcium phosphate (Coll-CaPs) combination was selected as the best option to mimic natural bone tissue. To accelerate the mineralization process, Zn2+ ions were inserted by substitution in CaPs. A superior thin film homogeneity was assessed by MAPLE, as shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microscopy. A decrease of P-O and amide absorbance bands was observed as a consequence of different Zn2+ amounts. A variety of structural modifications of the apatite layer are then generated, which influenced the confinement process towards the collagen template. The in-vitro Simulated Body Fluid (SBF) assay demonstrated the ability of Coll/Zn2+-CaPs coatings to stimulate the mineralization process as a result of synergic effects in the collagen-Zn2+ substituted apatite. For both deposition methods, the formation of droplets associated to the growth of CaPs particulates inside the collagen matrix was visualized. This supports the prospective behavior of MAPLE biomimetic coatings to induce mineralization, as an essential step of fast implant integration with vivid tissues.\n",
      "Tissue engineering (TE) sustains the excellent potential to elaborate functional materials or technologies mimicking the structural organization of natural tissues to raise or replace biological functions. The main purpose of TE is to avoid the organ transplantation. The artificial materials provided by TE to support 3D tissue formation are often improved by the seeding of cells into the material structure. To obtain proper tissue regeneration, it is important that the scaffold for TE application simulate the functional and also mechanical properties of extracellular matrix (ECM). Among the large numbers of scaffolding techniques, electrospinning (ES) is a remarkable one, which is able to produce nonwoven fibrous structures with dimensional constituents comparable to those of ECM fibers. In recent years, ES technique has received substantial interest as a viable tissue-engineering scaffolding method and has been described in many studies. ?? 2019 Elsevier Inc.

      "The main problem of IT-SOFC’s is the severe requirements that the electrolytes used have to satisfy, which among others are the following:(a) phase stability in both reducing and oxidising atmospheres for long periods of time in service (≥ 5000 h);(b) high and stable electrical conductivity (≥ 10-2 S· cm-1) at the fuel cell operating temperature; and (c) relatively high mechanical properties (σ≥ 500Mpa at room temperature and KIC≥ 3Mpa m1/2). Zirconia ceramics containing 3 mol% of Y2O3 and having a tetragonal structure,(Y-TZP) are currently being used, because of their strength and fracture toughness. However, at present there are two main problems with this kind of electrolyte: its low ionic conductivity at the SOFC operating temperature and, on the other hand, its very bad ageing behaviour, given the metastability of the tetragonal zirconia solid solutions. Although zirconia ceramics containing between 3 and 6.5 mol% Y2O3 (Y-PSZ) presented better ageing behaviour and higher ionic conductivity, these properties could be seriously affected by the characteristics and annealing behaviour of a dual (tetragonal+ cubic) microstructure, typical for these kinds of zirconia ceramics. Fully stabilised zirconia (FSZ), with a cubic structure, containing 6.5 and 10 mol% Y2O3, is the most attractive zirconia ceramic to be used as an electrolyte in SOFC systems, due to its improved electrical properties.

      "In recent years, the demand for dielectric resonators has been increasing owing to their usage in wireless communications. In this regard, microwave dielectric ceramics are helpful due to their technologically congruent properties, as well as the intrinsic ability of reduced component sizes. There are three important parameters that a dielectric resonator material should have, so that it can meet the desired requirements: a high dielectric constant (εr), a low loss at microwave frequencies (usually expressed as a high Q× f value) and a near-zero value of the temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency (τf). These are essential for a stable resonant frequency, possible miniaturization of the device and temperature stabile circuits, respectively.[1, 2] BaMg1/3Ta2/3O3 (BMT) ceramic has a complex perovskite structure and shows Q× f values up to 400 THz at frequencies close to 10 GHz [2]. A compromise on the microwave dielectric properties is made by replacing tantalum with less expensive niobium ions. The common method for preparation of BMT-based ceramics is the conventional solid-state reaction method. However, in order to achieve very good dielectric properties, this method requires high sintering temperature (~ 1600 C) and long annealing time (~ 100 h)[2]. Several authors reported improvement in sinterability by using sintering aids or dopants or by adding glasses [2, 3].\n",

Based on XRD, pure HA has been obtained while FTIR analyses confirm the formation of the desired composite materials, and in the case of chitosan/hydroxyapatite/methylene blue composite materials, even the presence of methylene blue can be proved. Based on the FTIR microscopy it seems that methylene blue is preferentially distributed onto the hydroxy apatite. The antibacterial activity was tested against E. coli and prove that chitosan induce antibacterial effect while the addition of methylene blue further improve this activity.

      "In the last decade various oxide semiconductors [1-4] have been used as catalyst, phosphor, gas sensor, photocatalyst, UV-photoprotector, varistor or in dye-sensitized solar cells [5-10]. The field of applications is determined by the electrical, optical and structural properties of the semiconductors. Among them, ZnO offers some unique optoelectronic properties due to its wide bandgap of 3.3 eV and large excitonic binding energy of 60 meV. Due to the special optical properties, high transparencies in the visible domain coupled with high absorbance of the UV radiation, ZnO has been toughly investigated as a coating material, from paints [11], to sunscreens [12] and fabric coating [13]. The photocatalytic activity of ZnO is well known and has been investigated versus a wide variety of pollutants. There are some application where a high photocatalytic activity is desirable [14], but there are also some application where ZnO capacity to degrade various organic substrate is an impediment, like f abric or paper coating. Doping of ZnO with transition metals (TM) can lead to ferromagnetic properties at room temperature (RT FM), might form dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) and is an effective way to tune the properties of ZnO [15, 16]. The doping TM will create some unoccupied states that will consequently alter of the band gap energy [17]. The presence of a dopant ion in the ZnO lattice can influence also the photocatalytic capacity of the nanoparticles, in both directions, giving an easy method to tune this property to suit various applications [18-20].

      "During recent years a lot of efforts have been made for achievement of novel biological luminescent nanocrystals and fluorescent biological labels for medical diagnostics and targeted therapeutics applications [1-12]. Hydroxyapatite, Ca10 (PO4) 6 (OH) 2 has a hexagonal structure with P63/m space group and cell dimensions of a= b= 9.42 Å and c= 6.88 Å [13-14]. Synthetic hydroxyapatite (HAp) ceramic is a preferred material for substitute of filling material for sclerous tissues because of its good biocompatibility and osteoconductivity [15-16]. Moreover, synthesis of ceramics offers several advantages including shorter synthesis time, rapid heating, fast reaction, easy reproducibility, narrow particle distribution, high yield, high purity [17-23].

      "Zinc oxide like many semiconductors has various technical applications [1-13], but it is also used in a series of cosmetic preparates, sun protection cream, acne treatment or as a wound dressing [14-24]. Application of zinc oxide has been shown to accelerate the healing of both chronic and acute wounds and it also exhibit antibacterial and anti-inflammatory behaviour [25, 26]. ZnO effect on epithelialisation of wounds as well as its bacteriostatic property promotes it as a topical wound dressing. It can be used in treatment of various dermatitis, diaper rashes, diaper wipes, blisters, and open skin sores [27-30]. As different bacterial strains become increasingly resistant to antibiotics, the search for new strategies to deal with the diseases causing bacteria intensifies. Researchers need to identify and develop the next generation of drugs or agents to control bacterial infections [31-43]. Another major concern is related to the growth of fungal pathogens. It is difficult to control fungal growth because fungi have developed resistance to many conventional fungicides such as benzimidazoles and dicarboximides. To overcome this resistance, it is important to explore novel antifungal agents, which may replace current control strategies [44-50]. The antibacterial effect of adhesive zinc tapes on streptococci and staphylococci were described by Gilje as early as 1949 [51]. In dentistry, the antibacterial effects of zinc oxide have been reported [52]. In a study by Södeberg et al.[53], it was found that Gram-positive bacteria were the most susceptible bacterial group to zinc ion and Gram-negative aerobic bacteria were usually not inhibited.

      "Nanocrystalline ZnO particles were prepared from methanolic solutions of zinc acetate dihydrate without using base such as NaOH or LiOH through a colloid process carried out at a low temperature of 60??C. The precipitate obtained after 12-72h contained ZnO, covered with polymeric species of zinc hydroxo acetate. The reaction course was studied by mass spectrometry means. To complete the hydrolysis process, up to pure ZnO, it was necessarily to reflux the white precipitate separate from methanolic solution, in water at 80??C. We found that reaction time in the presence of methanol primarily influenced the size of the particles, while the reaction time in the presence of water mainly influenced the ZnO purity.\n",

      "One new, promising approach in the medical field is represented by hydroxyapatite doped with luminescent materials for biomedical luminescence imaging. The use of hydroxyapatite-based luminescent materials is an interesting area of research because of the attractive characteristics of such materials, which include biodegradability, bioactivity, biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, non-toxicity, and their non-inflammatory nature, as well their accessibility for surface adaptation. It is well known that hydroxyapatite, the predominant inorganic component of bones, serves a substantial role in tissue engineering, drug and gene delivery, and many other biomedical areas. Hydroxyapatite, to the detriment of other host matrices, has attracted substantial attention for its ability to bind to luminescent materials with high efficiency. Its capacity to integrate a large assortment of substitutions for Ca2+, PO43−, and/or OH− ions is attributed to the versatility of its apatite structure. This paper summarizes the most recently developed fluorescent materials based on hydroxyapatite, which use rare earth elements (REEs) as dopants, such as terbium (Tb3+), erbium (Er3+), europium (Eu3+), lanthanum (La3+), or dysprosium (Dy3+), that have been developed in the biomedical field.\n",

      "Semiconductor nanoparticles have attracted interests of many academic and industrial researchers because of their unusual optoelectronic properties. Wurtzite ZnO is an n-type semiconductor with a wide band-gap. Nanosized ZnO can be utilized in electrochemical fields including chemical sensors [1], photocatalysts [2, 3], phosphors [4], thin films [5] and dyesensitized solar cells [6]. Pure zinc oxide is a degenerate semiconductor with a wide bandgap (3.3 eV) and has transparent properties in the visible range of the spectrum. Therefore, it is used in the production of many optoelectronic devices as transparent conducting oxides (TCO), like solar cells or flat panel displays. In order to improve the TCO properties of ZnO, it is usually doped with metallic ions. Doping of ZnO with magnetic transition metals (TM) creates ferromagnetic properties at room temperature (RT FM) and might form dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs)[7]. The suitability of DMS for spintronics applications is derived from its ability to dope a fraction of host semiconductor cations with magnetic ions. Theoretical prediction suggests that the common semiconductors doped with qualified TM in the range of several atomic percent lead to the development of the RT FM [8].\n",

Nanosized ZnO can be utilized in electrochemical fields including chemical sensors [5], photocatalysts [6, 7], thin films [8, 9], dye-sensitized solar cells [10] and in various optoelectronic devices as well as in spintronics [11]. ZnO is a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 3.37 eV having an excitonic binding energy of 60 meV. The literature is abundant in reports of ZnO photoluminescence. The photoluminescence spectra of ZnO powders usually presents two emission peaks in the UV and visible ranges [12], the relative intensity of which strongly depended on O2 pressure used during the synthesis process [13]. These luminescence effects have been assigned to electronic transitions involving the conduction band, the valence band, and various intrinsic or extrinsic defect levels lying within the band gap.\n",

      "<jats:p>Background and objectives: Medical devices such as catheters are used on a large scale to treat heart and cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, they present some important drawbacks (structure failure, calcifications, infections, thrombosis, etc.), with the main side effects occurring due to adhesion and proliferation of bacteria and living cells on the surface of the implanted devices. The aim of this work is to modify the surface of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), an affordable biocompatible material, in order to reduce these aforementioned side effects. Materials and Methods: The surface of PVC was modified by depositing a thin layer also of PVC that incorporates an active substance, dicoumarol (a well-known anticoagulant), by spin coating process. The modified surfaces were analyzed by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS), and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to determine the surface morphology and behavior. The samples were tested for Gram-positive (S. aureus ATCC 25923) and Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853) standard strains from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Results: The material obtained had a smooth surface with a uniform distribution of dicoumarol, which is released depending on the deposition parameters. The concentration of dicoumarol at the surface of the material and also the release rate is important for the applications for which the surface modification was designed. PVC modified using the proposed method showed a good ability to prevent salt deposition and decreased the protein adhesion, and the resistance to bacterial adherence was improved compared with standard PVC.</jats:p>\n",

      "The aim of this chapter is to discuss the advances in the field of soft tissue engineering highlighting the advantages of the use of drug delivery systems instead of pure, regenerative grafts. Tissue engineering evolved dramatically, from natural occurring materials to cell-seeded and drug-loaded engineered materials, from macro- to micro- and nanoscale. It is most important to mention the evolution from the last century because this is the period when, based on scientific approaches, the outcomes became exponential. From an evolutionary point of view, both pure regenerative as well as the drug-loaded systems are now studied, in preclinical and clinical phases. In fact, these two general classes of systems should be studied together because the properties of the drug-loaded systems are strongly dependent on the support characteristics. In the field of soft tissue engineering, some materials are intensively studied: chitosan and its derived materials; collagen and gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol, polycaprolactone, etc. The recent advances in this field are related to the active components which are used for loading these materials in order to improve or even induce new properties/functionalities. Special attention over recent decades has been devoted to the faster healing, antimicrobial and antitumoral activity of these materials and, consequently, this chapter is mainly devoted to these aspects.\n",

These results indicate that the crystallite size decreases by a factor of 2. The micro deformations increase at first and then tend to almost zero at the end of the sorption cycle. This behaviour is explained in terms of co-existence of the metal (i.e. α phase) and metal hydride (i.e. β phase) phases.

      "Since their discovery, nanomaterials have been intensively studied for both industrial and medical applications. For the medical sector, one important aspect, which is being increasingly recognized, is the safety concerns related to the handling and use of nanomaterials. Currently, scientists are trying to determine whether the benefits outweigh the risks. This special issue is structured in several subtopics covering: carbon based materials alone or in association with other nanostructured components; various nanoparticles, including quantum dots; or composite nanomaterials as regenerative or drug delivery systems. In the field of carbon based materials, two very hot subjects are discussed, namely, the influence of nitrogendoped multiwall carbon nanotubes on the proliferation of fibroblasts and the possibility of the use of Pt nanoparticle/graphene composite materials as electrochemical sensor of hydrogen peroxide. The efficiency of the Pt/graphenemodified glassy carbon (GC) electrodes was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, the main difference between the samples being the size of the nanoparticles (1.3; 1.7; 2.9; and 4.3 nm). The authors found that best results (highest reduction current, the best detection limit, and the best sensitivity) are obtained for the electrodes containing 1.7 nm Pt nanoparticles. Nitrogen-doped multiwall carbon nanotubes were found to be well tolerated below 7 g/mL and consequently are suggested by the authors as safe for use in biomedical applications below certain concentrations.

In this study, the influence of various synthesis parameters on the crystallinity and the composition of calcium phosphate powders were investigated. Firstly, the influence of the chemical nature of the calcium precursor was studied, by using two types of water-soluble calcium salts: CaCl2 center dot 2H(2)O and Ca(NO3)(2). Secondly, the effect of the pyrolysis temperature, in the 600-1000 degrees C interval was studied. Whatever the temperature of pyrolysis of the aerosol, the apatite structure is recognizable, if the precursor used for the calcium oxide is calcium chloride. If the powders are elaborated starting from calcium nitrate, the only phase identified is P-calcium phosphate. The synthesized powders have spherical morphology, are highly porous and dimensionally in the nanometric range. (C) 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \\& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.\n",
      "One of the major objectives of dental medicine that should be mentioned is the use of increasingly powerful materials of coronary restoration, as regards to their biomechanical, biofunctional and bio-prophylactic characteristics. Nanotechnologies often provide the techniques used in the field of filler particles. Solutions to obtain a first generation of composite material with nanoparticles with dimensions between 5-75 nm have been successfully tested. It has been important to also obtain conglomerates with dimensions between 0.2-0.6 mm, that should be present. The present paper describes the preparation through sol-gel methods and aims to characterize ceramic nanoparticles used as filling inorganic materials for dental composites for esthetical restorations. We have obtained nanometric powders of silica and zirconia/silica. Thermal treatments were conducted at temperatures between 700 degrees C and 1200 degrees C for 2 hours. The powders had been analyzed as regards to their mineralogical composition, granulometric distribution and microstructure. (C) 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \\& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.\n",
      "High dielectric materials have gained an important position in microwave electronics by reducing the size and cost of components for a wide range of applications from mobile telephony to spatial communications. Ba(Zn1/3Ta2/3)O3 (BZT) is an A(BB)O3 type perovskite material, showing ultra high values of the quality factor Q. Ceramic-based BZT dielectric materials were prepared by solid state reaction. The samples were sintered at temperatures in the range 1400  1600C for 4h. Compositional, structural and morphological characterization were performed by using XRD, SEM and EDX analysis. The dielectric properties were measured in the microwave range (6  7GHz). An additional annealing at 1400C for 10h has improved some dielectric parameters. For samples sintered at temperatures higher than 1500C, the permittivity values were obtained in the interval 30  35 and almost do not change the value after the annealing. The Q  f product substantially increases up to about 135,000GHz, exhibiting a low temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency (τf) in microwaves. The best parameters were obtained for the samples sintered at 1600C with additional annealing. The achieved high values of the Q  f product recommend these materials for microwave and millimeter wave applications.  2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Stents are medical devices that are increasingly used in medical practice. Unfortunately, existing materials present certain disadvantages and lead to high failure risk. In this context it is necessary to develop new materials or to improve the existent ones by functional coatings. Titanium based stents exhibit reasonable surface properties and, if coated with a titanium oxynitride layer their performances for both medical [1-3] and engineering applications [4-6] can be further improved. Based on numerous works, stents coated with a TiOxNy film, exhibit superior clinical performance compared with uncoated stents especially due to the low adherence of platelets and fibrinogen [7, 8]. In this study, the synthesis of TiO2 nanopowders was carried out by three different routes, in order to optimize the N: O ratio, in particularly, and thus to design the characteristics of the obtained nanopowders. The first synthesis route involved the chemical modification of the titanium dioxide (anatase form), by exposure at the action of ammonia 25% under magnetic stirring for 12h, followed by drying at 80 C overnight. TiOxNy nanoparticles were obtained with average particle size of 20-30nm, but also particles as large as 100nm in diameter can be identified. The second synthesis route involved in hydrolysis of titanium isopropoxide in concentrated ammonia. Hydrolysis was carried out by maintaining titanium isopropoxide in NH4OH (25%) for 12h, under magnetic stirring, followed by drying at 80 C overnight.

      "Plastic wastes are generated by a variety of sources, including consumer goods, packaging, automotive, electrical and electronic industries, leading to significant growth in the volume of wastes and the impetuous need of their management [1]. The storage of plastic wastes is extremely difficult and has become a social problem in recent years, globally [2]. Recycling these products, is considered one of the best ways to save and protect the environment, although, applied technologies must be designed and managed to avoid environmental pollution especially because the half-life of most plastics is of tens of years [3]. For this purpose, special attention must be paid to recycling polyethylene terephthalate (PET) because it is the polymer most commonly used worldwide as packaging material for water as well as other drinks. Compared with other types of waste from polymer materials, PET can be easily collected, recycled and turned into new value-added products in industrial applications (not for food applications). In order to improve physical, mechanical and thermal properties of the products derived from PET wastes, the polymer melt was reinforced with surface modified flax fibres and fabrics. In this study two routes of flax fabric functionalization with adequate titanium and aluminum precursors are presented. The first synthesis route involves the treatment of the cellulosic material with the precursor (AlCl3 or Ti (C4H9O) 4), followed by precipitation of the Al2O3 or TiO2 by addition of an aqueous 1M NaOH solution (when use AlCl3) or water (when use titanium butoxide).

      "Recently, the application of biopolymers in solving environmental problems has received considerable attention (Ghaedi et al., 2013). Natural polymers, especially polysaccharides (typical examples, chitosan and alginate) that are readily available, inexpensive and biodegradable, possess numerous reactive amino groups able to participate in metal ion adsorption (Hritcu et al., 2012). To improve chitosan’s performance as an adsorbent, cross-linking reagents such as glyoxal, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, epichlorohydrin, ethylene glycon diglycidyl ether and isocyanates have been used (Wan Ngaha WS et al., 2011). The quality and characteristics of chitosan products, such as purity, viscosity, molecular weight, polymorphic structure and the degree of deacetylation may differ due to many factors in the production process, thereby affecting the nature of the final product (Radomski et al., 2014). Organic-inorganic hybrids are promising classes of materials whose structure includes both organic and inorganic units that interact with each other at the molecular level. Organic-inorganic hybrid polymers can be obtained through different ways: 1-sol-gel process; 2-self-assembly process; 3-assembling or dispersion of nanobuilding blocks; 4-hierarchical structures and 5-interpenetrating networks (Samiey et al., 2014). This paper describes the method of synthesis for the hybrid organic-inorganic polymeric based on chitosan reinforced with MCM-48 mesoporous silica functionalized with aminopropyltrimethoxisilane (APTMS), used for removal of divalent metal ions from wastewaters.

      "The paper presents a study concerning thermoplastic nanocomposites having polypropylene as the matrix and different contents of carboxyl-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes as the nanofiller. The materials are obtained by melt compounding the nanofiller powder and polymer pellets through the extrusion process followed by injection molding into specific-shape specimens. The materials are evaluated in terms of mechanical properties such as the tensile and flexural strengths and moduli, the thermal stability under load (the heat deflection temperature) and the thermal-behavior properties using a TG-DSC analysis. The fracture cross-section is analyzed using FTIR spectroscopy and SEM microscopy to evaluate the bulk characteristics of the materials.

      "For the first time we presented the preliminary results of biocompatibility studies on bioceramic hydroxyapatite powders doped with europium Ca 10-xEu x(PO 4) 6 (OH) 2, with 0.01 ??? X Eu ??? 0.2 prepared at low temperature by a simple coprecipitation approach. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies revealed the characteristic peaks of hydroxyapatite in each sample. No evidence for additional crystalline phases was found, proving the complete substitution of Eu in the HAp lattice in the whole range of concentrations. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations suggest that these materials present a little different morphology, which reveals a homogeneous aspect of the synthesized particles for all samples. The PL investigations shown the PL intensity changed considerably by varying the X Eu. The value of X Eu in the hydroxyapatite formula has almost no effect on the wavelength of emission peaks. In order to test Hap_Eu biocompatibility, the effect of europium substituted hydroxyapatite nanocristalline powders with different X Eu on cell viability and proliferation of HEK293 cell line were evaluated. The in vitro investigation showed no significant decrease of viability of HEK293 cell line and low levels of intracellular lipid peroxidation in the Hap_Eu treated cells. In conclusion, the results suggest that Eu doped HAp has low toxicity and exhibit a good biocompatibility.\n",

Numerous reasearchesare activated in this domain in order to obtain materials/surfaces that does not have drawbacks such asstructural failure, calcifications, infections or thrombosis. One of the most used material ispoly(vinylchloride) (PVC) due to its unique properties, availability and low cost. The most commonmethod used for obtaining tubular devices that meet the requirements of medical use is the surfacemodification of polymers without changing their physical and mechanical properties, in bulk. PVC is ahydrophobic polymer and therefore many research studies were conducted in order to increase the hydrophilicityof the surface by chemical modification in order to improve biocompatibility, to enhancewettability, reduce friction or to make lubricious or antimicrobial coatings. Surface modification ofPVC can be achieved by several strategies, in only one step or, in some cases, in two or more steps byapplying several techniques consecutively to obtain the desired modification / performances.

      "<jats:p>Cardiovascular diseases are the most distributed cause of death worldwide. Stenting of arteries as a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty procedure became a promising minimally invasive therapy based on re-opening narrowed arteries by stent insertion. In order to improve and optimize this method, many research groups are focusing on designing new or improving existent stents. Since the beginning of the stent development in 1986, starting with bare-metal stents (BMS), these devices have been continuously enhanced by applying new materials, developing stent coatings based on inorganic and organic compounds including drugs, nanoparticles or biological components such as genes and cells, as well as adapting stent designs with different fabrication technologies. Drug eluting stents (DES) have been developed to overcome the main shortcomings of BMS or coated stents. Coatings are mainly applied to control biocompatibility, degradation rate, protein adsorption, and allow adequate endothelialization in order to ensure better clinical outcome of BMS, reducing restenosis and thrombosis. As coating materials (i) organic polymers: polyurethanes, poly(ε-caprolactone), styrene-b-isobutylene-b-styrene, polyhydroxybutyrates, poly(lactide-co-glycolide), and phosphoryl choline; (ii) biological components: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and anti-CD34 antibody and (iii) inorganic coatings: noble metals, wide class of oxides, nitrides, silicide and carbide, hydroxyapatite, diamond-like carbon, and others are used.

      "This paper aims to review the challenges, toxicity, and routes of synthesis and usage of silver nanoparticles in different medical applications but also highlighting their sustainability from both medical and environmental issues. Regarding their toxicity, it is known that silver nanoparticles can destroy over 650 microorganisms comparing with antibiotics. Supplementary, will be presented in a comparative manner some conventional synthesis routes (physical and chemical methods) and green synthesis routes using plant extracts. The approach using plant extracts have various advantages comparing with physical, chemical and microbial synthesis methods because there is no need to use chemicals, wasteful purifications and high energy requirements. The main focus in &amp;ldquo;green nanotechnology&amp;rdquo; was to use either biological micro-organisms or plant extracts which are an alternative to the classical chemical and physical methods. An important issue that is discussed in the paper is the potential toxicity of silver nanoparticles that may have on human health or on the environment, which powerfully indicates that, the usage and removal of silver nanoparticles must be carefully examined. Also, it needs to focus our attention on the dismissal of silver nanoparticles into the environment and especially in water systems, fact which suggests that this issue must be fully understood and apply accordingly the law.\n",

      "In recent years, the demand for dielectric resonators has been increasing owing to their usage in wireless communications. In this regard, microwave dielectric ceramics are helpful due to their technologically congruent properties, as well as the intrinsic ability of reduced component sizes. There are three important parameters that a dielectric resonator material should have, so that it can meet the desired requirements: a high dielectric constant (εr), a low loss at microwave frequencies (usually expressed as a high Q f value) and a near-zero value of the temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency (τf). These are essential for a stable resonant frequency, possible miniaturization of the device and temperature stabile circuits, respectively.[1, 2] BaMg1/3Ta2/3O3 (BMT) ceramic has a complex perovskite structure and shows Q f values up to 400 THz at frequencies close to 10 GHz [2]. A compromise on the microwave dielectric properties is made by replacing tantalum with less expensive niobium ions. The common method for preparation of BMT-based ceramics is the conventional solid-state reaction method. However, in order to achieve very good dielectric properties, this method requires high sintering temperature (~ 1600 C) and long annealing time (~ 100 h)[2]. Several authors reported improvement in sinterability by using sintering aids or dopants or by adding glasses [2, 3].\n",

      "The aim of this work is the preparation and characterization of cubic zirconia nanopowders stabilised with 10 mol % scandia. The sol-gel method was employed for the preparation of the nanopowders, using zirconium propoxide and scandium chloride/oxide as precursors. The nanopowders were characterised through thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction and consequently treated at temperatures under 1000 oC. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM/HRTEM) with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were used for compositional and microstructural characterization of nanopowders. For samples treated at 700 oC, cubic zirconia is identified as only crystallographic phase. TEM analyses showed dimensions of particles of approximately 10 to 20 nm for samples treated at 700 oC and 85 to 90 nm for higher thermal treatment temperature of 1000 oC The shape of particles is mainly polyhedral and they present a low tendency of forming agglomerates.\n",
      "Over the past decade, electrospinning, a broadly used technology for electrostatic fibre formation which utilizes electrical forces to produce polymer fibres with diameters ranging from several nanometres to several micrometres using natural/synthetic polymer solutions has seen a tremendous increase in both research and commercial applications. This process offers unique capabilities for producing novel natural nanofibers and fabrics with controllable pore structure using different polymers [1-5]. Co-axial processing of alginate gels offers an alternative procedure to synthesized hollow fibres and nanobeads. The challenge of the procedure is to adequately choose the needles diameter, the flows of through the two needles, the concentrations of the solutions, etc. Alginate/natural agent hollow fibres were successfully synthesized by coaxial electrospinning method using 3% alginate solution, 1-5 % natural agent and CaCl2 solutions (1 - 100g/L) as reticulation agent. The rapid consolidation of the alginate hollow tubes is assured by passing a CaCl2 solution through the inner needle while these alginate structures are directly poured into the CaCl2 solution when hollow fibres with controlled characteristics were obtained. Natural agents such as pure polyphenols, antibiotics, analgesic, were loaded inside the wall of the alginate hallow fibres. The obtained hollow fibres were characterized by FTIR, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), tubes shrinking and water uptake. These structures will be evaluated from the point of view of loading and delivery of biological active agents such as natural or synthetic agents: antioxidants, anti-inflammatory or antimicrobial agents. The as obtained hollow fibres were also evaluated from the point of view of biocompatibility against endothelial cells but also according to their potential antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory activity. ?? 2019 Avestia Publishing.\n",
      "Nanocrystalline ZnO particles doped with Mn(II) ions were prepared by a forced hydrolysis method of zinc acetate dihydrate and manganese acetate tetrahydrate, under reflux, in buthanol. The precipitate obtained was separated by centrifugation at 9.000 rpm and purified by refluxing in water. The dopant percentage was 1, 2.5 and 5%. The qualitative composition of the nanopowder has been evidenced in the elemental EDS maps. Optical investigation shows that the Mn doping in ZnO lattice leads to a decrease in the near band edge position due to the introduction of new unoccupied states by Mn 3d electrons. The luminescence of ZnO is quenched by increasing the dopant ions percentage. At doping rate of 1% Mn in the ZnO lattice a tenfold decrease in intensity of luminescence was observed, along with modification of the luminescence pattern. Further increases of dopant percent from 1% to 5% had as result a decrease of only 30% in the luminescence intensity. The photocatalytic activity was investigated against methylene blue. The increase of Mn percentage leads to a better photocatalytic activity.\n",

      "Hydroxyapatite is a compound that is found naturally in bone structures of animal bodies. Synthetic hydroxyapatite due to its structure and absence of toxicity, finds many applications including the manufacture of artificial components for medical use or as a support in controlled drug release systems. Materials in the nanometer size exibihit some specific outstanding physical properties, which can be significantly different properties of bulk materials. In this study will show the influence of preparation methods on the properties of hydroxyapatite, shape and size. Synthesis methods chosen for this study are methods for obtaining hydroxyapatite powders of nanometric level, namely: sol-gel, precipitation and pyrosol. Characterization in terms of phase compositions was performed by XRD; the shape and size of the powders was performed by SEM and TEM microscopy analysis. The X-ray diffraction data highlight the formation of hydroxyapatite by all three methods, and the microscopy data show different shapes and sizes, even though it started from the same chemical precursors and the same concentration.

Later, methylene blue was added dropwise because the composite material is intended to act as support for releasing methylene blue; the release of methylene blue ensuring the antiseptic nature of the material.The composites were then characterized by: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) while the release process was monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy.The characterization of the collagen/hydroxyapatite composite material revealed a good mineralization of collagen matrix a high stability of the mineral phase, as well as the capacity to bind/absorb methylene blue.From the point of view of the release process, the results showed a gradual release that was evidenced by UV-Vis spectroscopy, the release evolution being monitored at a wavelength of 663 nm, characteristic.Therefore, studies suggest the use of collagen/hydroxyapatite composite material as support for tissular regeneration of bone tissue, methylene blue providing antiseptic properties.\n",
      "The iron oxide nanoparticles were synthetized by an adapted coprecpitation method. Stuctural and morphological characterization of the obtained iron oxide nanoparticles were investigated by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies were investigated by cell viability assay and HeLa cells. For the analysis of iron oxide toxicity in vivo, several mice were treated with normal saline and iron oxide via intraperitoneal injection (IP). The XRD spectra showed the peaks associated to the spinel cubic lattice type with the lattice of 0.835 nm. By magnified TEM image, it could be observed that the samples have a uniform morphology with relatively spherical shape and nanometric size. Moreover, inverted fluorescence microscopy images of HeLa cells with normal phenotype and HeLa cells treated for 72 hourswith a suspension of ??-Fe2O3 nanoparticles revealed the non-toxic character.

      "The paper's aim is to present the preparation and characterization of ceramic sensors in SnO2-ZrO2 binary system, using nanopowders obtained through co-precipitation from the corresponding chlorides.All nanopowders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The XRD results show specific diffraction lines of tin oxide solid solutions and tetragonal zirconia solid solutions. The TEM examination shows particle size being below 10 nm with tendency of agglomeration in large agglomerates.For ceramic sensors obtaining, the nanopowders were shaped and thermally treated in air for sintering, at temperatures between 9000 and 1300 degrees C, for 2 hours.In order to determine the sensitivity of ceramic sensors, the electrical resistanced was measured in air, in methane saturated atmosphere and in methanol vapor saturated atmosphere, as well. The obtained sensors are more sensitive to methanol than to methane, the compositions with a higher amount of tin oxide showing higher sensitivity values to both methanol and methane.\n",
      "We have studied the influence of the substitution of Al for Ni in the ternary systems RENi5-xBx (RE=Gd, Y). The compounds synthesized in the pseudo-ternary systems RENi4-xAlBx (RE=Gd, Y) were studied in terms of their crystal structure, chemical composition and hydrogen sorption properties. Most of the compounds obtained in these systems crystallize with the CeCo4B-type structure RENi3AlB, with Al atoms replacing Ni. The partial replacement of Ni by Al observed leads to a decrease of lattice parameters compared to ternary RENi4B compounds. The new pseudo-binary phase GdB3 was also observed in this study for the first time. Finally, it is reported that the compounds do not show any affinity towards hydrogen, with no absorption observed.\n",

For the heat treatment at 1500 degrees C the soaking time was varied from 3 to 6 hours.The microstructure and phase composition of the dense sintered ceramic composites were determined through the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The compressive strength and Young's modulus of sintered composites were measured, too.

      "Accelerated Portland Cement (APC) was obtained by the mixing of white mineral trioxide aggregate (WMTA), synthesised by sol-gel method, with an accelerator addition-CaCl2. APC has a rapid setting but lower values of the compressive strength developed after 28 days of hardening at 37??C (as compared with WMTA).The decrease of the compressive strength is due to the modirication induced by CaCl2 presence in the binding system - both microstructure and composition are affected; large pores and micro cracks were assessed in the microstructure of APC pastes, opposite to the much denser WMTA microstructure. Moreover, given the high amount of CaCl2 used in this work (10% wt.), it is also possible the formation of a new hydrate phase i. e, calcium hydroxyl chloride. The APC biocompatibility, assessed by an in-vitro test (SBF soaking of APC powder) and cytotoxicity of APC specimen, hardened for 28 days, on Hep2 cells was very good.\n",

A total replacement of Ni by Fe and/or Co is sometimes possible, meaning that a total solid solution exists between RENi4B and REFe4B or RECo4B. Also, the boron is assumed to partially occupy two different crystallographic sites, although only one of these is mainly occupied by boron.

The evaluated results were obtained from thousands of monitoring tests carried out worldwide and in Romania, after 2006. The measurements cover most of the production technologies and a great variety of waste based alternative fuels. Due to the conditions inherent to clinker production: high temperatures, approx. 2000 C for gases and long residence times of flue gases in the kiln (about 10 seconds at temperatures higher than 1100 - 1200 C and 5 - 6 second at temperatures over 1800C), the release of dioxins and furans from clinker kilns is very low, no matter the fuels, even when alternative fuels based on hazardous waste are used. As a result of the existing conditions, a DRE (destruction and removal factor) of 99.9999% can be reached in the clinker kilns for POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants), like dioxins and furans. The measurements carried out worldwide and in Romania confirm the very low level of dioxin and furan emissions of clinker kilns.\n",

X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used for to characterize the composition, morphology and particle size of samples. At 800??C a small amount of CaO (about 0.3 wt%) was detected in which increased after annealing at 1000??C (about 1.1 wt%). The crystallites are elongated along the c crystallographic axis, but the size anisotropy decreases with increasing temperature above 800??C. The size along the elongation axis increased from 43 nm at 80??C to about 143 nm at 1000??C, as determined by XRD, and from 120 to 280 nm, as measured by TEM. The functional groups were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopies confirming the presence of various po34-and OH- bands in the samples. After calcination at 1000??C the bands are more intense which indicates an increase in the cristallynity.

      "The bio-compatible magnetic nanoparticles of maghemite were prepared by a chemical co- precipitation method and dextran was selected as the surfactant to suspend them. By transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the iron oxide nanoparticles appeared nearly spherical with an average diameter of about 8.0 ??1 nm. SAED pattern of iron oxide nanoparticles is indexed by a cubic ??-Fe2O3, the diffraction rings are attributed to the (220), (311), (400), (422), (511) and (440) planes, respectively. Regular fringes are clearly observed in the nanoparticle with a spacing of 0.24 nm, which is the (311) interplanar distance of the cubic maghemite. This is in perfect agreement with the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) results, indicating that the nanoparticles are well crystallyzed in spite of their ultrafine sized.

      "Dielectric materials continue to have a decisive influence on the evolution of the electrical and electronic engineering, communications and information technology. Among these, materials which exhibit high dielectric constant, low dielectric losses, and good temperature stability are required to reduce the size and weight of equipment, enhance its reliability, and lower the manufacturing and operational costs. Ceramic materials are from far the most utilized as they offer cost-effective solutions for applications [1-4]. The high dielectric constant materials are of particular interest for microwave domain, as they are used for microwave resonators and filters. These materials are presently employed as bulk ceramics in microwave communication devices, as discrete components in hybrid circuits. The ceramic pieces are designed to be dielectric resonators, resonating at the frequency of the carrier signal to allow that signal to be efficiently separated from other signals in the microwave band. The Ba (Zn1/3Ta2/3) O3 dielectric materials (BZT) are very attractive for microwave devices due to their high dielectric constant and low losses in the microwave and millimeter wave range [5-7]. These materials exhibit a dielectric constant of εr∼ 29 and a high value of the Q x f product, around 100,000 GHz. Moreover, the temperature coefficient of the resonance frequency τf takes positive values lower than 6 ppm/oC. The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of the sintering temperature and the annealing treatment on microwave dielectric properties of BZT ceramics.\n",

Once, alternating, electromagnetic fields are applied, due to the developed hyperthermia, the delivery rate can be intensified, as we have already proved for systems with other composition. The as obtained hybrid alginate/magnetite drug delivery platforms were characterized by FTIR, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), chemical stability and drug delivery profile. In addition, the biocompatibility of alginate/magnetite/polyphenols platforms was investigated by XTT assay after exposing the endothelial cells to different concentrations of platforms with various composition. ?? 2019 Avestia Publishing.\n",
      "<jats:p>This paper offers a general view of the solutions that are able to confer bioactivity to the packaging materials, especially antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. These properties can be induced by the nature of the polymers blend or due to the addition of ternary components from natural agents (essential oils or other extracts) to synthetic organic and inorganic agents, including nanoparticles with a broad antimicrobial activity such as metals (e.g., Ag, Au, Cu) or metal oxide (e.g., TiO2, ZnO) nanoparticles, and even bacterial cells such as probiotics. Many times, these components are synergistically used, each of them assuring a specific role or potentiating the role of the other components. The antimicrobial activity can be induced due to the applied coatings or due to the whole bulk material. Along with an increasing food stability which means a longer shelf-life some smart packaging can be exploited in order to highlight the freshness of the food. These act as a sensor (usually pH sensitive but also other mechanisms can be exploited such as aggregation/agglomeration of AuNPs leading to color change or even aldehyde-specific reactions such as the Cannizzaro reaction), and thus, consumers can be confident about the freshness of the food, especially perishable food such as seafood or fish.</jats:p>\n",
      "<jats:p>In recent years, researchers focused their attention on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) owing to the considerable advancements of the characterization methods, especially electron microscopy methods, which allowed for a clear visualization of the pore structure and the materials encapsulated within the pores, along with the X-ray diffraction (small angles) methods and specific surface area determination by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) technique. Mesoporous silica gained important consideration in biomedical applications thanks to its tunable pore size, high surface area, surface functionalization possibility, chemical stability, and pore nature. Specifically, the nature of the pores allows for the encapsulation and release of anti-cancer drugs into tumor tissues, which makes MSN ideal candidates as drug delivery carriers in cancer treatment. Moreover, the inner and outer surfaces of the MSN provide a platform for further functionalization approaches that could enhance the adsorption of the drug within the silica network and the selective targeting and controlled release to the desired site. Additionally, stimuli-responsive mesoporous silica systems are being used as mediators in cancer therapy, and through the release of the therapeutic agents hosted inside the pores under the action of specific triggering factors, it can selectively deliver them into tumor tissues. Another important application of the mesoporous silica nanomaterials is related to its ability to extract different hazardous species from aqueous media, some of these agents being antibiotics, pesticides, or anti-tumor agents. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the methods of MSN synthesis and related characteristics, the available surface functionalization strategies, and the most important applications of MSN in adsorption as well as release studies. Owing to the increasing antibiotic resistance, the need for developing materials for antibiotic removal from wastewaters is important and mesoporous materials already proved remarkable performances in environmental applications, including removal or even degradation of hazardous agents such as antibiotics and pesticides.</jats:p>\n",
      "This paper presents experimental results for liquid waste inertization in chemicaly bonded phosphate ceramic (CBPC). This process turns waste hazardous in non-hazardous waste. It was studied the inertization of liquid wastes containing heavy metals (Ba, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb) with concentrations between 3000 mg/l and 30000 mg/l in CBPC versus inertization in portland cement paste. As the CBPC is a fast setting system, it was also used boric acid as retarder in concentration of 3% (based on the amount of magnesium oxide and potassium dihydrogen phosphate). To increase the efficiency of cadmium inertization, phosphoric acid was added. Also it was studied the influence of sodium dimetilditiocarbamate. It was determined the maximum temperature of the obtained systems, the setting time and compression strength. To determine the effectiveness of waste inertization it was performed leaching tests in water and in acid solution, and the obtained values were compared with regulated limits. ?? 2016, Procema SA.

The effect of the nSiC presence and content is evaluated taking into consideration mechanical, tribological and thermal behavior. Mechanical testing consisted of compression and 3-point bending tests, the results indicating that the strength and stiffness are improved in the case of nanofilled sample. Tribological testing illustrated that friction coefficient increased with nSiC content increase. Thermal behavior was evaluated by TG-DSC analyses and thermal shock tests (at 1100??C), the post-test mass loss analyses showing that nSiC is able to act as a thermal protection agent, improving thermal resistance of these materials.

      "We have studied the influence of the substitution of Al for Ni in the ternary systems RENi5-xBx (RE=Gd, Y). The compounds synthesized in the pseudo-ternary systems RENi4-xAlBx (RE=Gd, Y) were studied in terms of their crystal structure, chemical composition and hydrogen sorption properties. Most of the compounds obtained in these systems crystallize with the CeCo4B-type structure RENi3AlB, with Al atoms replacing Ni. The partial replacement of Ni by Al observed leads to a decrease of lattice parameters compared to ternary RENi4B compounds.

      "This paper aims at providing more recent information concerning dioxins and furans emissions in cement plants. The evaluated results were obtained from thousands of monitoring tests carried out worldwide and in Romania, after 2006. The measurements cover most of the production technologies and a great variety of waste based alternative fuels. Due to the conditions inherent to clinker production: high temperatures, approx. 2000 ??C for gases and long residence times of flue gases in the kiln (about 10 seconds at temperatures higher than 1100 - 1200 ??C and 5 - 6 second at temperatures over 1800??C), the release of dioxins and furans from clinker kilns is very low, no matter the fuels, even when alternative fuels based on hazardous waste are used. As a result of the existing conditions, a DRE (destruction and removal factor) of 99.9999% can be reached in the clinker kilns for POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants), like dioxins and furans.

      "Background and objectives: In the last few years, graphene oxide has attracted much attention in biomedical applications due to its unique physico-chemical properties and can be used as a carrier for both hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic biomolecules. The purpose of this paper was to synthesize graphene oxide and to obtain multifunctional platforms based on graphene oxide as a nanocarrier loaded with few biologically active substances with anticancer, antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory properties such as gallic acid, caffeic acid, limonene and nutmeg and cembra pine essential oils. Materials and Methods: Graphene oxide was obtained according to the method developed by Hummers and further loaded with biologically active agents. The obtained platforms were characterized using FTIR, HPLC, TGA, SEM, TEM and Raman spectroscopy. Results: Gallic acid released 80% within 10 days but all the other biologically active agents did not release because their affinity for the graphene oxide support was higher than that of the phosphate buffer solution. SEM characterization showed the formation of nanosheets and a slight increase in the degree of agglomeration of the particles. The ratio I-2D/I-G for all samples was between 0.18 for GO-cembra pine and 0.27 for GO-limonene, indicating that the GO materials were in the form of multilayers. The individual GO sheets were found to have less than 20 mu m, the thickness of GO was estimated to be similar to 4 nm and an interlayer spacing of about 2.12 angstrom. Raman spectroscopy indicated that the bioactive substances were adsorbed on the surface and no degradation occurred during loading. Conclusions: These findings encourage this research to further explore, both in vitro and in vivo, the biological activities of bioactive agents for their use in medicine.\n",

Grouping more antimicrobials agents in the same packaging can create a synergic effect, resulting in either a better antimicrobial activity against a wider spectrum of spoilage agents or a lower required quantity of antimicrobials. In the present work, we obtained a biodegradable antimicrobial film that can be used as packaging material for food. Films based on chitosan as biodegradable polymer, with ZnO and Ag nanoparticles as filler/antimicrobial agents were fabricated by a casting method. The nanoparticles were loaded with citronella essential oil (CEO) in order to enhance the antimicrobial activity of the nanocomposite films. The tests made on Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and fungal strains indicated a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, with inhibition diameters of over 30 mm for bacterial strains and over 20 mm for fungal strains. The synergic effect was evidenced by comparing the antimicrobial results with chitosan/ZnO/CEO or chitosan/Ag/CEO simple films.

An optimal wound dressing should be nontoxic, non-adherent, non-allergenic, should also maintain a humid medium at the wound interfacing, and be easily removed without trauma. For the development of functional and bioactive dressings, they must meet different conditions such as: The ability to remove excess exudates, to allow gaseous interchange, to behave as a barrier to microbes and to external physical or chemical aggressions, and at the same time to have the capacity of promoting the process of healing by stimulating other intricate processes such as differentiation, cell adhesion, and proliferation. Over the past several years, various types of wound dressings including hydrogels, hydrocolloids, films, foams, sponges, and micro/nanofibers have been formulated, and among them, the electrospun nanofibrous mats received an increased interest from researchers due to the numerous advantages and their intrinsic properties. The drug-embedded nanofibers are the potential candidates for wound dressing application by virtue of: Superior surface area-to volume ratio, enormous porosity (can allow oxy-permeability) or reticular nano-porosity (can inhibit the microorganisms’adhesion), structural similitude to the skin extracellular matrix, and progressive electrospinning methodology, which promotes a prolonged drug release.

The biological effects of IONP and X-ray irradiation (50 kV and 6 MV) were determined in HeLa cells using the colony formation assay (CFA) and detection of γH2AX foci. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. IONP were efficiently internalized by HeLa cells. IONPCO radiomodulating effect was dependent on nanoparticle concentration and photon energy. IONPCO did not radiosensitize HeLa cells with 6 MV X-rays, yet moderately enhanced cellular radiosensitivity to 50 kV X-rays (DMFSF0.1 = 1.13 ± 0.05 (p = 0.01)). IONPDOX did enhance the cytotoxicity of 6 MV X-rays (DMFSF0.1 = 1.3 ± 0.1; p = 0.0005). IONP treatment significantly increased γH2AX foci induction without irradiation. Treatment of HeLa cells with IONPCO resulted in a radiosensitizing effect for low-energy X-rays, while exposure to IONPDOX induced radiosensitization compared to IONPCO in cells irradiated with 6 MV X-rays. The effect did not correlate with the induction of γH2AX foci.

      "In order to obtain a drug delivery system used in tumoral treatment, this study presents the characterization of mesoporous silica /antitumor drug hybrid materials obtained in A NOVEL METHOD OF SYNTHESIS FOR NANOPOROUS SILICA MATERIALS [1]. There were synthesized eight hybrid materials, using two types of mesoporous silica as support material and irinotecan respectively thyme oil as active substances. Mesoporous silica was synthetized using two techniques, classical sol-gel and novel microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, resulting different structural characteristics for materials. Loading with irinotecan was realized in aqueous solution at neutral and acidic pH environment using impregnation method with drug solution. Other four materials were synthesized using thyme oil 3% and 5%. In this study hybrid materials were characterized using different techniques such as X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, Thermal analysis, scanning electron microscopy which offered morpho-structural information.

      "<jats:p>The petroleum-based materials could be replaced, at least partially, by biodegradable packaging. Adding antimicrobial activity to the new packaging materials can also help improve the shelf life of food and diminish the spoilage. The objective of this research was to obtain a novel antibacterial packaging, based on alginate as biodegradable polymer. The antibacterial activity was induced to the alginate films by adding various amounts of ZnO nanoparticles loaded with citronella (lemongrass) essential oil (CEO). The obtained films were characterized, and antibacterial activity was tested against two Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhi) and two Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) bacterial strains. The results suggest the existence of synergy between antibacterial activities of ZnO and CEO against all tested bacterial strains. The obtained films have a good antibacterial coverage, being efficient against several pathogens, the best results being obtained against Bacillus cereus. In addition, the films presented better UV light barrier properties and lower water vapor permeability (WVP) when compared with a simple alginate film. The preliminary tests indicate that the alginate films with ZnO nanoparticles and CEO can be used to successfully preserve the cheese. Therefore, our research evidences the feasibility of using alginate/ZnO/CEO films as antibacterial packaging for cheese in order to extend its shelf life.</jats:p>\n",
      "Design of nano-and/or cluster-sized photocatalysts within mesoporous silica-based materials have been widely studied for heterogeneous photocatalytic processes in the past several decades (Qian et al., 2014). The adsorption of organic substrates as well as crystallinity of the TiO2 photocatalyst can be largely affected by the nature of the used support (Kannaiyan et al., 2010). Mesoporous materials such as clays, zeolites and mesoporous silica, are considered an ideal class of catalyst supports because their large surface areas and uniform pore size distribution permit easy diffusion of large organic molecules toward internal active sites (Wang Z., 2007). Recently, much attention has been drawn to the preparation of porous silica-titania materials that have a higher percentage of the titania in a uniformly dispersed state, since such materials have some advantages compared to pure titanium oxide (Ruzimuradov et al., 2011). Photocatalytic components such as anatase can be embedded in the mesoporous silica using the following synthesis methods: wet impregnation, inner-pore hydrolysis/nonhydrolysis, co-hydrolysis and cocondensation, sol-gel processes and sol-gel/hydrothermal methods (Masolo et al., 2014). This paper presents the synthesis and characterization of the mesoporous material based on MCM41/TiO2, used as a potential material with catalytic activity for degradation of organic pollutants. The synthesis of this type of material with catalytic properties occurs in two stages. In the first stage, the mesoporous silica with MCM-41 hexagonal pores is synthesized, using the following components and amounts. 0.5g of CTAB with the role of pores forming agent or template are stirred with 96ml H2O until the solution becomes clear, followed by adding 34ml ethyl alcohol and ammonia solution with a concentration of 25%. After homogenization, TEOS (tetraethylorthosilicate) is added slowly and stirred for 3h, subsequently followed by filtration and drying. The surfactant is removed by calcination at 5500C for 9 h, according to the DTA-TG analysis. The formation of the MCM-41 with hexagonal pores was confirmed by XRD. The incorporation of the titanium precursor in the pores of mesoporous silica was done using an adequate amount of titanium (IV) isopropoxide reported to the amount of MCM-41, the final content of anatase being 1 and 10% respectively. The titanium precursor was absorbed into the mesopores under vacuum followed by hydrolysis of the precursors. In order to prevent hydrolysis and facilitate adsorption of titanium (IV) isopropoxide in the pores of mesoporous silica, the former is added as mixture in ethyl alcohol, followed by solvent evaporation in the oven at the temperature of 800C.\n",

Preparation of dense HAp ceramics with superior stability is possible if the starting powders are very fine [1-5]. Synthesis methods that are imitating the physiological conditions seem also to lead to materials with improved properties [1-6]. The hydroxyapatite powders were obtained through chemical methods, from Ca (NO3) 2 10H2O and (NH4) 2HPO4, mixed in stoichiometric proportions.

Compositional and structural similarities or differences between the powder synthesized from egg-shells (HA1) and the two commercial xenograft powders—Bio-Oss®, totally deproteinized cortical bovine bone, and Gen-Os®, partially deproteinized porcine bone—were revealed. The HA1 specimen presented a single mineral phase as polycrystalline apatite with a high crystallinity (Xc 0.92), a crystallite size of 43.73 nm, preferential growth under the c axes (002) direction, where it mineralizes in bone, a nano-rod particle morphology, and average lengths up to 77.29 nm and diameters up to 21.74 nm. The surface of the HA1 nanoparticles and internal mesopores (mean size of 3.3 ± 1.6 nm), acquired from high-pressure hydrothermal maturation, along with the precursor’s nature, could be responsible for the improved biocompatibility, biomolecule adhesion, and osteoconductive abilities in bone substitute applications. The cytotoxicity assay showed a better AFSC cell viability for HA1 powder than the commercial xenografts did, similar oxidative stress to the control sample, and improved results compared with Gen-Os.

The strong peaks at 1593, 83cm-1 and 1406, 26cm-1 are due to the CC stretching of the aromatic groups. Another significant peak at 1050, 15cm-1 is attributed to the CO stretching of the alcohols, carboxylic acids, esters and ethers functional groups; another peak at 948cm-1 attributed to OH bend of carboxylic acids group. And the last peaks identified at 884cm-1 and 815cm-1 are assigned to the CH vibrations from the aromatic groups. Regarding thermal analysis, it can be stated that forth weight loss regions were observed. The first weight loss of~ 12% from 2000C may correspond to the desorption of the adsorbed water. The second weight loss of~ 32% between 200-2700C showed an asymmetric exothermic peak, indicating an oxidative degradation.

In this paper, we review the main advances in the development of these magnetic polymer films and derived MEMS: microvalve, micropump, micromixer, microsensor, drug delivery micro-systems, magnetic labeling and separation microsystems, etc. It is important to mention that these MEMS are continuously improving from the point of view of performances, energy consumption and actuation mechanism and a clear tendency in developing personalized treatment. Due to the improved energy efficiency of special materials, wearable devices are developed and be suitable for medical applications.</jats:p>\n",
      "During the past few years, researchers have focused their attention on developing innovative nanocomposite polymeric membranes with applications in water purification. Natural and synthetic polymers were considered, and it was proven that chitosan-based materials presented important features. This review presents an overview regarding diverse materials used in developing innovative chitosan-based nanocomposite polymeric membranes for water purification. The first part of the review presents a detailed introduction about chitosan, highlighting the fact that is a biocompatible, biodegradable, low-cost, nontoxic biopolymer, having unique structure and interesting properties, and also antibacterial and antioxidant activities, reasons for using it in water treatment applications. To use chitosan-based materials for developing nanocomposite polymeric membranes for wastewater purification applications must enhance their performance by using different materials. In the second part of the review, the performances features will be presented as a consequence of adding different nanoparticles, also showing the effect that those nanoparticles could bring on other polymeric membranes. Among these features, pollutants retention and enhancing thermo-mechanical properties will be mentioned. The focus of the third section of the review will illustrate chitosan-based nanocomposite as polymeric membranes for water purification. Over the last few years, researchers have demonstrated that adsorbent nanocomposite polymeric membranes are powerful, important, and potential instruments in separation or removal of pollutants, such as heavy metals \n",
      "The purpose of this article was to synthesize antimicrobial composite membranes using chitosan (CS) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles as adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals. Chitosan/ZnO composite membranes were prepared through the electrospinning method. The ZnO nanoparticles concentration from the CS/ZnO composite membranes was 1% and respectively, 5%. The synthesized membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential thermal analysis (DTA), hydration capacity, antimicrobial assessments and, heavy metal retention through the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis technique. The thickness of the as-prepared CS/ZnO composite membranes was 20 mu m (CS/ZnO 1%) and 30 mu m (CS/ZnO 5%). The appearance of the synthesized membranes indicated a smooth and uniform morphology, which suggested the integration of zinc oxide nanoparticles into the obtained membrane. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic measurements showed the existence of relevant functional groups of both chitosan and ZnO in the composite membranes. ICP-MS measurements provided information regarding the capacity of retention of these membranes, indicating that CS/ZnO 5% had the highest retention rate. The as-obtained CS/ZnO composite membranes are expected to be used as adsorbent materials for water purification applications.\n",

      "4. Conclusions 2. Experimental 1. Introduction 3. Results and discussions Page 1 4. Conclusions Based on the FTIR results it can conclude that TiO 2 nanoparticles showed a broad intense band at 3430,63cm-1 represented the NH stretching frequency. A strong absorption peak at 1779,64cm-1 is assigned to the C=O vibration of anhydride group. The presence of the peaks from 1779,04cm-1 and the one at 1639,76cm-1 are due to the symmetric C=O stretching of the carbonyl groups. Another significant peaks at 1449,41cm-1 and 1162,48cm-1 is attributed to the CH stretching of the alkane's functional groups. Regarding XRD analysis, it can be observed that the material synthesized indicates the presence of pure crystalline anatase TiO 2 phase. Line broadening of the diffraction peaks indicates that the synthesized materials were at nanometric scale. The crystallite sizes were calculated using the Scherrer formula \n",

The hydroxyapatite synthesis was performed under controlled conditions in order to obtain monodisperse, fine nanoparticles and to avoid later uncontrolled deposition of these nanoparticles, starting from Ca(OH)(2) and (NH4)(2)HPO4. The obtained dried precipitate was thermal treated, then suspended in curcumin - dichloromethane solution (where curcumin was added in order to represent 5%, 10% wt. from the amount of hydroxyapatite) and homogenized until solvent evaporation. Morphological and structural characterization, as well as in vitro characterization were performed. All samples were biologically tested and antitumor studies were performed.\n",

The purpose was to obtain YBa2Cu3O7-delta with nanosized crystallites by a new synthetic pathway, since the literature data reported so far are limited, using stoichiometric amounts of yttrium acetate with barium and copper nitrate without the addition of organic fuel. The auto-combustion reaction transformed the precursor gel into a dark-brown ash powder, during an intense self-ignited exothermic reaction. After calcination at 900 degrees C the obtained black powder was sintered using Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) at 510 degrees C.

      "<jats:p>The synthesis of nanoparticles from noble metals has received high attention from researchers due to their unique properties and their wide range of applications. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), in particular, show a remarkable inhibitory effect against microorganisms and viruses. Various methods have been developed to obtain AgNPs, however the stability of such nanostructures over time is still challenging. Researchers attempt to obtain particular shapes and sizes in order to tailor AgNPs properties for specific areas, such as biochemistry, biology, agriculture, electronics, medicine, and industry. The aim of this study was to design AgNPs with improved antimicrobial characteristics and stability. Two different wet chemical routes were considered: synthesis being performed (i) reduction method at room temperatures and (ii) solvothermal method at high temperature. Here, we show that the antimicrobial properties of the obtained AgNPs, are influenced by their synthesis route, which impact on the size and shape of the structures. This work analyses and compares the antimicrobial properties of the obtained AgNPs, based on their structure, sizes and morphologies which are influenced, in turn, not only by the type or quantities of precursors used but also by the temperature of the reaction. Generally, AgNPs obtained by solvothermal, at raised temperature, registered better antimicrobial activity as compared to NPs obtained by reduction method at room temperature.</jats:p>\n",
      "This research aims to synthesize hydroxyapatite powders from a biogenic calcium source (hen eggshell) and study the effect of two maturation methods (a classical method and a combined short time maturation at 135 degrees C in microwave-assisted hydrothermal conditions) on its final properties. The synthesized specimens consist of nanomefric polycrystalline particles of carbonated apatite, with enhanced osteogenic effect due to the presence of trace elements, and high crystallinity (up to 72.44%). It was concluded that the maturation conditions impacted the morpho-sfructural and compositional characteristics of the obtained powders, as well as their cytotoxic behavior in contact with mouse osteoblasts MC3T3-E1 culture.\n",
      "The improved drug delivery systems (DDS) are needed for the targeted delivery of their therapeutic cargo (biologically active protein/peptide molecules, nucleic acids, vaccines, etc.) to diseased cells. Thus, we aimed to develop magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4), stabilized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and decorated (surface-functionalized) with folic acid (FA) (Fe3O4@PEG@FA) to ensure targeted internalization in cells expressing the folic acid receptors (FR). The Fe3O4@PEG@FA nanoparticles were synthesized by co-precipitation in a one-pot methodology. Curcumin (Curc), a polyphenol with anti-tumoral activity, was loaded on the nanoparticles, and FA-targeted (Fe3O4@PEG@FA@Curc) and non-targeted (Fe3O4@PEG@Curc) systems were obtained. The internalization of Fe3O4@PEG@FA@Curc and Fe3O4@PEG@Curc nanoparticles was determined in two tumor cell lines, the FR-positive MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cell line and A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, expressing a low level of FR. The results showed that MCF-7 cells internalize FA-functionalized nanoparticles to a greater extent than non-targeted ones and also than A549 cells. The competitive studies performed in the presence of FA in excess suggested that internalization is an FR-dependent process. The increased internalization of Fe3O4@PEG@FA@Curc nanoparticles in MCF-7 cells is correlated with increased cytotoxicity in this cell line compared to A549 cells. In conclusion, the FA-functionalized magnetic systems can ensure a better internalization of the nanoparticles and can be used to deliver various therapeutic agents, both in cancer treatment and also in the treatment of other inflammation-associated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, osteoarthritis, Crohn's disease or atherosclerosis.\n",
      "For more than five decades, alkali niobate-based materials (KxNa1-xNbO3) have been one of the most promising lead-free piezoelectric materials researched to be used in electronics, photocatalysis, energy storage/conversion and medical applications, due to their important health and environmentally friendly nature. In this paper, our strategy was to synthetize the nearest reproductible composition to KxNa1-xNbO3 (KNN) with x = 0.5, placed at the limit of the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) with the presence of both polymorphic phases, orthorhombic and tetragonal. The wet synthesis route was chosen to make the mix crystal powders, starting with the suspension preparation of Nb2O5 powder and KOH and NaOH alkaline solutions. Hydrothermal microwave-assisted maturation (HTMW), following the parameter variation T = 200-250 degrees C, p = 47-60 bar and dwelling time of 30-90 min, was performed. All powders therefore synthesized were entirely KxNa1-xNbO3 solid solutions with x = 0.06-0.69, and the compositional, elemental, structural and morphological characterization highlighted polycrystalline particle assemblage with cubic and prismatic morphology, with sizes between 0.28 nm and 2.95 mu m and polymorphic O-T phase coexistence, and a d 33 piezoelectric constant under 1 pC/N of the compacted unsintered and unpoled discs were found.\n",
      "Polymeric materials, due to their excellent physicochemical properties and versatility found applicability in multiples areas, including biomaterials used in tissue regeneration, prosthetics (hip, artificial valves), medical devices, controlled drug delivery systems, etc. Medical devices and their applications are very important in modern medicine and the need to develop new materials with improved properties or to improve the existent materials is increasing every day. Numerous reasearches are activating in this domain in order to obtain materials/surfaces that does not have drawnbacks such as structural failure, calcifications, infections or thrombosis. One of the most used material is poly (vinyl chloride)(PVC) due to its unique properties, availability and cost. The most common method used for obtaining tubular devices that meet the requirements of medical use is the surface modification of polymers without changing their physical and mechanical properties, in bulk. PVC is a hydrophobic polymer and therefore many researches were conducted in order to increase the hydrophilicity of the surface by chemical modification in order to improve biocompatibility, to enhance wettability, reduce friction or to make lubricious or antimicrobial coatings. Surface modification of PVC can be achieved by several strategies, in only one step or, in some cases, it is necessary to use two or more techniques consecutively to obtain the desired modification/performances. The most common processes used for modifying the surface of PVC devices are: plasma treatment, corona discharge, chemical grafting, electric discharge, vapour deposition of metals, flame treatment \n",

      "<jats:p>As it is used in all aspects of human life, water has become more and more polluted. For the past few decades, researchers and scientists have focused on developing innovative composite adsorbent membranes for water purification. The purpose of this research was to synthesize a novel composite adsorbent membrane for the removal of toxic pollutants (namely heavy metals, antibiotics and microorganisms). The as-synthesized chitosan/TiO2 composite membranes were successfully prepared through a simple casting method. The TiO2 nanoparticle concentration from the composite membranes was kept low, at 1% and 5%, in order not to block the functional groups of chitosan, which are responsible for the adsorption of metal ions. Nevertheless, the concentration of TiO2 must be high enough to bestow good photocatalytic and antimicrobial activities. The synthesized composite membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and swelling capacity. The antibacterial activity was determined against four strains, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. For the Gram-negative strains, a reduction of more than 5 units log CFU/mL was obtained. The adsorption capacity for heavy metal ions was maximum for the chitosan/TiO2 1% composite membrane, the retention values being 297 mg/g for Pb2+ and 315 mg/g for Cd2+ ions. These values were higher for the chitosan/TiO2 1% than for chitosan/TiO2 5%, indicating that a high content of TiO2 can be one of the reasons for modest results reported previously in the literature. The photocatalytic degradation of a five-antibiotic mixture led to removal efficiencies of over 98% for tetracycline and meropenem, while for vancomycin and erythromycin the efficiencies were 86% and 88%, respectively. These values indicate that the chitosan/TiO2 composite membranes exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. The obtained composite membranes can be used for complex water purification processes (removal of heavy metal ions, antibiotics and microorganisms).</jats:p>\n",
      "<jats:p>Since its first use as a drug delivery system, mesoporous silica has proven to be a surprisingly efficient vehicle due to its porous structure. Unfortunately, most synthesis methods are based on using large amounts of surfactants, which are then removed by solvent extraction or heat treatment, leading to an undesired environmental impact because of the generated by-products. Hence, in the present study, we followed the synthesis of a silica material with a wormhole-like pore arrangement, using two FDA-approved substances as templates, namely Tween-20 and starch. As far as we know, it is the first study using the Tween-20/starch combo as a template for mesoporous silica synthesis. Furthermore, we investigated whether the obtained material using this novel synthesis had any potential in using it as a DDS. The material was further analyzed by XRD, TEM, FT-IR, N2 adsorption/desorption, and DLS to investigate its physicochemical features. Vancomycin was selected as the active molecule based on the extensive research engaged towards improving its bioavailability for oral delivery. The drug was loaded onto the material by using three different approaches, assuming its full retention in the final system. Thermal analysis confirmed the successful loading of vancomycin by all means, and pore volume significantly decreased upon loading, especially in the case of the vacuum-assisted method. All methods showed a slower release rate compared to the same amount of the pure drug. Loadings by physical mixing and solvent evaporation released the whole amount of the drug in 140 min, and the material loaded by the vacuum-assisted method released only 68.2% over the same period of time, leading us to conclude that vancomycin was adsorbed deeper inside the pores. The kinetic release of the three systems followed the Higuchi model for the samples loaded by physical mixing and vacuum-assisted procedures, while the solvent evaporation loading method was in compliance with the first-order model.</jats:p>\n",

      "We report a facile method to synthesize magnetite nanoparticles with mesoporous structure by coprecipitation method using different stabilizing agents like salicylic acid, glutamic acid, and trichloroacetic acid. The stabilizing agents were used to prevent the aggregation of the magnetite nanocrystals and to obtain stable nanostructures even in the biological environment. The structure and morphology of magnetic nanocrystals were determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, infrared (IR) spectra, scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The results reveal important differences between these magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), which are mainly attributed to the stabilizing agents. The smallest nanoparticles were obtained in the presence of trichloroacetate ions. The mechanism of formation of these suprastructures is strongly correlated with the end functional groups of the stabilizing agent. Thus, the obtained nanoparticles are potential candidates for contrast agents as well as targeted carrier for specific diseases, especially cancer.\n",
      "Due to the water problem, our attention is focused on developing innovative membranes for water purification. Among the biodegradable biopolymers, the ones based on polysaccharides like chitosan have presented great interest. After cellulose, chitosan is produced by chitins deacetylation, the most bountiful natural polysaccharide. The reason polysaccharides such as chitosan attracted special attention was because of their availability in nature, bio-renewability, sustainability, and having low-cost and impressive performance compared to other materials used in water treatment [1]. Due to having interesting composition and structure and unique physicochemical properties, chitosan provides plenteously of prospects through physical and chemical approaches to expand the applications in removing contaminants from water sources. Chitosan, an important adsorbent material, presents significant usage for removing toxins from drinking or wastewater, including microorganisms, heavy metals, dyes, and phenols [2]. Studies have shown that embedding chitosan with different nanomaterials like silver, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, silica, magnetite, graphene oxide and zeolite printed good antimicrobial properties to the membranes. Therefore, based on the results presented in [3], ZnO nanoparticles' antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains has been proven. S. aureus bacteria were the most sensitive tested strain. Starting from the antimicrobial results presented, there is a high interest in developing nanocomposite membranes for water purification. For instance, Zhu et al.[4] developed TiO2/ZnO/chitosan nanocomposite \n",
      "The main problem of IT-SOFCs is the severe requirements that the electrolytes used have to satisfy, which among others are the following:(a) phase stability in both reducing and oxidising atmospheres for long periods of time in service ( 5000 h);(b) high and stable electrical conductivity ( 10-2 S cm-1) at the fuel cell operating temperature; and (c) relatively high mechanical properties (σ 500Mpa at room temperature and KIC 3Mpa m1/2). Zirconia ceramics containing 3 mol% of Y2O3 and having a tetragonal structure,(Y-TZP) are currently being used, because of their strength and fracture toughness. However, at present there are two main problems with this kind of electrolyte: its low ionic conductivity at the SOFC operating temperature and, on the other hand, its very bad ageing behaviour, given the metastability of the tetragonal zirconia solid solutions. Although zirconia ceramics containing between 3 and 6.5 mol% Y2O3 (Y-PSZ) presented better ageing behaviour and higher ionic conductivity, these properties could be seriously affected by the characteristics and annealing behaviour of a dual (tetragonal+ cubic) microstructure, typical for these kinds of zirconia ceramics. Fully stabilised zirconia (FSZ), with a cubic structure, containing 6.5 and 10 mol% Y2O3, is the most attractive zirconia ceramic to be used as an electrolyte in SOFC systems, due to its improved electrical properties. However, it must be noted that both the mechanical and thermal properties of these zirconia ceramics are not as good as desired and consequently many efforts are being\n",

      "In recent years, the demand for dielectric resonators has been increasing owing to their usage in wireless communications. In this regard, microwave dielectric ceramics are helpful due to their technologically congruent properties, as well as the intrinsic ability of reduced component sizes. There are three important parameters that a dielectric resonator material should have, so that it can meet the desired requirements: a high dielectric constant (εr), a low loss at microwave frequencies (usually expressed as a high Q f value) and a near-zero value of the temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency (τf). These are essential for a stable resonant frequency, possible miniaturization of the device and temperature stabile circuits, respectively.[1, 2] BaMg1/3Ta2/3O3 (BMT) ceramic has a complex perovskite structure and shows Q f values up to 400 THz at frequencies close to 10 GHz [2]. A compromise on the microwave dielectric properties is made by replacing tantalum with less expensive niobium ions. The common method for preparation of BMT-based ceramics is the conventional solid-state reaction method. However, in order to achieve very good dielectric properties, this method requires high sintering temperature (~ 1600 C) and long annealing time (~ 100 h)[2]. Several authors reported improvement in sinterability by using sintering aids or dopants or by adding glasses [2, 3].\n",

      "In drug therapy, it is important to provide therapeutic levels of drug to the site of action (or at least in the blood) and maintain them during the treatment [1]. Furthermore, it is desirable to minimize temporal variations in drug concentration by using modified drug delivery systems (MDDS) to avoid periods of over-dosing or under-dosing. The modifications involve changes in the rate and/or time and/or site of drug release in comparison with conventional formulations by delaying drug release (extended release systems), targeting drug release (site-specific release systems), prevention or reduction of side effects, taste masking or improving drug solubility. New strategies are focused on increasing drug stability and on simultaneously modifying drug delivery patterns (particulate delivery systems)[2]. These changes are achievable by several possible mechanisms, including modifications in pharmaceutical formulations and/or method of preparation. Clay minerals (layered silicates) have been proposed as fundamental constituents of several MDDS, with different purposes and acting through various mechanisms [3]. The intercalation of organic species into layered inorganic materials provides a useful and convenient route to prepare organic-inorganic hybrids that combine the properties of both inorganic host and organic guest [4, 5]. A very interesting possibility is to use clay mineral polymer composites to modify drug release.

      "In the last decade various oxide semiconductors [1-4] have been used as catalyst, phosphor, gas sensor, photocatalyst, UV-photoprotector, varistor or in dye-sensitized solar cells [5-10]. The field of applications is determined by the electrical, optical and structural properties of the semiconductors. Among them, ZnO offers some unique optoelectronic properties due to its wide bandgap of 3.3 eV and large excitonic binding energy of 60 meV. Due to the special optical properties, high transparencies in the visible domain coupled with high absorbance of the UV radiation, ZnO has been toughly investigated as a coating material, from paints [11], to sunscreens [12] and fabric coating [13]. The photocatalytic activity of ZnO is well known and has been investigated versus a wide variety of pollutants. There are some application where a high photocatalytic activity is desirable [14], but there are also some application where ZnO capacity to degrade various organic substrate is an impediment, like f abric or paper coating. Doping of ZnO with transition metals (TM) can lead to ferromagnetic properties at room temperature (RT FM), might form dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) and is an effective way to tune the properties of ZnO [15, 16]. The doping TM will create some unoccupied states that will consequently alter of the band gap energy [17]. The presence of a dopant ion in the ZnO lattice can influence also the photocatalytic capacity of the nanoparticles, in both directions, giving an easy method to tune this property to suit various applications [18-20]. In our previous works, we have prepared pure and doped ZnO by force hydrolysis, sol-gel or pyrosol \n",
      "Functionalized magnetic nanoparticles are used in several biomedical applications, such as drug delivery, magnetic cell separation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast agents for diagnostics. Although there are several kinds of interesting magnetic nanoparticles, iron-oxide particle magnetite (Fe2O3) and its oxidized form maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) have attracted more attention because they are non-toxic and less susceptible to change due to oxidation. These facts make this kind of nanoparticles one of the most studied materials for biomedical applications [1-2]. The study of nanoscale magnetic materials domains is of both fundamental and pressing technical interest as the grain size of advanced recording media is rapidly shrinking to dimensions where as an example the magnetic properties depend strongly on nanocrystal size [3] with their characteristic size in the range 1-100 nanometers.

The crystallites are elongated along the c crystallographic axis, but the size anisotropy decreases with increasing temperature above 800 C. The size along the elongation axis increased from 43 nm at 80 C to about 143 nm at 1000 C, as determined by XRD, and from 120 to 280 nm, as measured by TEM. The functional groups were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman \n",
      "Abstract Europium doped hydroxyapatite (Eu: HAp) nanocristalline powders was synthesized by co-precipitation method by setting the atomic ratio of Eu/[Eu+ Ca] at 0% and 2% and [Ca+ Eu]/P at 1.67. The structural properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained on different samples using BET method. The X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that hydroxyapatite is the unique crystalline constituent of all the samples, indicating that Eu has been successfully inserted into the HAp lattice.

      "Zinc oxide like many semiconductors has various technical applications [1-13], but it is also used in a series of cosmetic preparates, sun protection cream, acne treatment or as a wound dressing [14-24]. Application of zinc oxide has been shown to accelerate the healing of both chronic and acute wounds and it also exhibit antibacterial and anti-inflammatory behaviour [25, 26]. ZnO effect on epithelialisation of wounds as well as its bacteriostatic property promotes it as a topical wound dressing. It can be used in treatment of various dermatitis, diaper rashes, diaper wipes, blisters, and open skin sores [27-30]. As different bacterial strains become increasingly resistant to antibiotics, the search for new strategies to deal with the diseases causing bacteria intensifies. Researchers need to identify and develop the next generation of drugs or agents to control bacterial infections [31-43]. Another major concern is related to the growth of fungal pathogens. It is difficult to control fungal growth because fungi have developed resistance to many conventional fungicides such as benzimidazoles and dicarboximides. To overcome this resistance, it is important to explore novel antifungal agents, which may replace current control strategies [44-50]. The antibacterial effect of adhesive zinc tapes on streptococci and staphylococci were described by Gilje as early as 1949 [51]. In dentistry, the antibacterial effects of zinc oxide have been reported [52]. In a study by Sodeberg et al.[53], it was found that Gram-positive bacteria were the most susceptible bacterial group to zinc ion and Gram-negative aerobic bacteria were usually not inhibited.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies revealed the characteristic peaks of hydroxyapatite in each sample. No evidence for additional crystalline phases was found, proving the complete substitution of Eu in the HAp lattice in the whole range of concentrations. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations suggest that these materials present a little different morphology, which reveals a homogeneous aspect of the synthesized particles for all samples. The PL investigations shown the PL intensity changed considerably by varying the xEu. The value of xEu in the hydroxyapatite formula has almost no effect on the wavelength of emission peaks.

      "* Regarding the values for relative density (ρrel) it can be observed the same influence as in the case of absorption and open porosity (the increase of temperature of the thermal treatment increases the relative density and the increase of alumina content decreases the relative density). For certain sets of samples thermally treated at 1600 C for 3 hours it can be noticed a decrease of relative densities caused by the creep behavior of the sample (which implies a deformation under the samples own weight which became possible due to the liquid phase formed in the sintering process).\n",
      "Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MION) doped dextran thin films for biomedical applications have been deposited onto the glass substrate by spin coating method.

      "The aim of this work is to obtain and characterize some collagen/hydroxyapatite composite materials obtained by collagen matrix immersion in SBF, for different immersion times. The obtained composite materials were characterize by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy detector (EDS) and complex thermal analysis. The main differences between the composites obtained by different immersion times can be visualized by SEM images. The increasing immersion time lead to a more compact composite material, with lower porosity as exhibited in the recorded SEM images. On the other hand, not only the morphology is changed but also the composition of the composites. At high immersion time, onto the composite materials, sodium chloride (NaCl) crystals can be observed. The presence of NaCl can be easily identified by XRD and, based on the relative characteristic peaks intensity can be quantified.\n",
      "With the recent progress in the microwave communication systems, microwave dielectric ceramics have become very important for the miniaturization of microwave devices such as filters or antennas [1, 2]. Ba (Mg1/3Ta2/3) O3 (BMT) ceramic possesses excellent dielectric properties: high quality factor (Q f> 400 THz), moderate dielectric constant (εr~ 25) and small temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (τf< 5 ppm/C), for microwave applications. BMT can have a disordered cubic complex perovskite structure with 1: 1 cationic order or a long range ordered (LRO), 1: 2 type, trigonal structure. The microwave quality factor of BMT ceramic material depends, especially, on the LRO, with repeated sequence-Mg-Ta-Ta- of cations on the perovskite B-site [1, 3, 4]. Because the sinterability of BMT is poor even at high temperatures of 1600 C, many investigations have been carried out to reduce the sintering temperature of BMT ceramic without deteriorating to much the microwave dielectric properties. Several authors reported improvement in sinterability by the use of sintering aids or dopants [1, 5]. Although they succeeded in improving the dielectric properties of BMT, sintering temperature remained above 1600 C in most cases. In this paper, the synthesis of undoped and doped BMT sintered pellets is reported. Nb2O5, V2O5 and Ga2O3 were added in small quantities ( 1 mol%) in order to improve the Q f product value of BMT ceramic. Different sintering temperatures, in the range (1550-1650) C, were applied.

      "Synthesis of biomimetic materials for implants and prostheses is a hot topic in nanobiotechnology strategies. Today the major approach of orthopaedic implants in hard tissue engineering is represented by titanium implants. A comparative study of hybrid thin coatings deposition was performed by spin coating and matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE) onto titanium substrates. The Collagen-calcium phosphate (Coll-CaPs) combination was selected as the best option to mimic natural bone tissue. To accelerate the mineralization process, Zn2+ ions were inserted by substitution in CaPs. A superior thin film homogeneity was assessed by MAPLE, as shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microscopy. A decrease of P-O and amide absorbance bands was observed as a consequence of different Zn2+ amounts. A variety of structural modifications of the apatite layer are then generated, which influenced the confinement process towards the collagen template. The in-vitro Simulated Body Fluid (SBF) assay demonstrated the ability of Coll/Zn2+-CaPs coatings to stimulate the mineralization process as a result of synergic effects in the collagen-Zn2+ substituted apatite. For both deposition methods, the formation of droplets associated to the growth of CaPs particulates inside the collagen matrix was visualized. This supports the prospective behavior of MAPLE biomimetic coatings to induce mineralization, as an essential step of fast implant integration with vivid tissues.\n",

Tricalcium phosphate Ca3 (PO4) 2 (β-TCP), an osteoconductive as well as bioresorbable ceramic, has found applications as bone cement and bone implant material, respectively.[1-4] This ceramics may by used in granular, dense or porous form. In recent years, attention was particularly placed on the fabrication of β-TCP with porous configuration because the porous network allows the tissue to infiltrate, which further enhances the implant-tissue attachment.[1] The most currently used production method for these foam structures is the polymeric sponge technique wherein soft polyurethane foams (PU-foam) is dipped into ceramic slurry. After elimination of the excess slurry and drying, the Pu-foams are burnt off and, after sintering, ceramic foams are obtained. This method has the advantage that the cell size of such structures are be easily adapted by starting from another PU-foam having the appropriate cell size. The proprieties of the ceramic slurries are crucial for the characteristics of the foams. Firstly, they should have high content of solids, in order to reduce the shrinkage during firing, good homogeneity and must be stable in time. In this work, in order to obtain stable slurry with solid content of 65wt% was used different additives like dispersant agents and binder.

      "In modern dentistry, the application of resinbased composites continues to increase, and in the majority of countries has completely replaced mercury amalgams [1]. This trend is generated by government legislation regarding the application of products that contain mercury and by their esthetic quality, fast and on-demand setting process, excellent physic-mechanical properties and for the chemical bonding potential with tooth tissue [2]. However, because of the differences related to chemical bonding of these materials, the interaction is very weak at the interface leading to no significant values in practical situations.

      "Calcium doped strontium barium niobate Sr0.5Ba0.5Nb2O6 (SBN:50) is a tungsten bronze ferroelectric material with a tetragonal unit cell. SrxCayBa1-x-yNb2O6 (SCBN) compositions with (x = 0.5; y = 0.14 and 0.28) were obtained by solid-state reaction method. The phase structure, microstructure and dielectric properties of obtained SCBN ceramics were systematically investigated. XRD results showed that SCBN phase with tungsten bronze structure could be obtained in all ceramic samples. Higher Ca content (y = 0.28) lead to occurrence of a secondary phase of CaNb2O6. SEM micrographs show the formation of crystallites with sharp boundaries with an average grain size of about 4 divided by 12 pm for all SCBN compositions. Compared with pure SBN:50 composition, Ca doping results in a reduction of the dielectric constant value, but the dielectric losses are found to be smaller for this compositions.\n",
      "The current antibiotics crisis observed in most hospitals and healthcare settings represents one of the global priorities today. In trying to solve this international problem, many countries constantly propose and develop wide packages of actions that they think should be agreed internationally. Some governments are optimistic on the success of these campaigns, highlighting that the cost of taking such actions can be small if the right steps are followed soon. A few are also stating that the benefits will be large and longlasting, especially for emerging economies, which will need to make improved investments in their health infrastructure and build industries that leapfrog to the next generation of innovation (Van Boeckel et al., 2014). However, despite the huge efforts of the control campaigns, the general crisis of antibiotics inefficiency increases constantly and most pessimistic researchers are afraid that the world may turn into a preantibiotic era. Antimicrobial-resistant infections currently claim at least 50,000 lives each year across Europe and the US only, with many hundreds of thousands more dying in other areas of the world (ONeill, 2014). Emerging resistance to treatments for severe infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV has enormous impact in lower-income settings. For example, there were an estimated 480,000 new cases of tuberculosis in 2013, of which the majority went untreated, most of them in developing countries (WHO, 2014). The studies estimate that over 300 million people are expected to die prematurely because of drug resistance over the next 35 years and that between now and 2050 the world can expect to lose\n",

The changes of (i) the lattice parameters, (ii) the crystallite size and (iii) the lattice strain during the sorption process (i.e. along the PC isotherms) were studied. These results indicate that the crystallite size decreases by a factor of 2. The micro deformations increase at first and then tend to almost zero at the end of the sorption cycle. This behaviour is explained in terms of co-existence of the metal (i.e. alpha phase) and metal hydride (i.e. beta phase) phases. The change in crystallinity is consistent with the hydrogen induced amorphisation process existing in a lot of ABsub 2 compounds. No anisotropic effects can be highlighted on this pseudo-ABsub 2 compounds in contrary with what could be observed in ABsub 5 compounds. (author)\n",

      "Magnesium is promising for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen capacity (ie 7.6 wt% of hydrogen), high resources and low cost [1]. The main disadvantages of MgH2 as a hydrogen storage media are the high temperature of hydrogen discharge, the slow desorption kinetics and the high reactivity towards air and oxygen [2] and [3]. In order to head off the poor reaction kinetics of the Mg, ball milling was used to modify the Mg surface. Metals, alloys and oxides [1] were also added to improve the kinetics (mainly by improving the dissociation of H2). Nevertheless, if the kinetics can be improved on that way, the thermodynamic remains unchanged [4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9] and [10].

      "In drug therapy, it is important to provide therapeutic levels of drug to the site of action (or at least in the blood) and maintain them during the treatment [1]. Furthermore, it is desirable to minimize temporal variations in drug concentration by using modified drug delivery systems (MDDS) to avoid periods of over-dosing or under-dosing. The modifications involve changes in the rate and/or time and/or site of drug release in comparison with conventional formulations by delaying drug release (extended release systems), targeting drug release (site-specific release systems), prevention or reduction of side effects, taste masking or improving drug solubility. New strategies are focused on increasing drug stability and on simultaneously modifying drug delivery patterns (particulate delivery systems)[2]. These changes are achievable by several possible mechanisms, including modifications in pharmaceutical formulations and/or method of preparation. Clay minerals (layered silicates) have been proposed as fundamental constituents of several MDDS, with different purposes and acting through various mechanisms [3]. The intercalation of organic species into layered inorganic materials provides a useful and convenient route to prepare organic-inorganic hybrids that combine the properties of both inorganic host and organic guest [4, 5]. A very interesting possibility is to use clay mineral polymer composites to modify drug release. Although clay minerals and polymers are frequently used as single drug carriers, this type of drug delivery system (DDS) often does not meet all requirements. Preparation of polymer layered silicate composite offers the possibility of \n",

      "<jats:p>Given the demanding use of controlled drug delivery systems, our attention was focused on developing a magnetic film that can be triggered in the presence of a magnetic field for both drug delivery and the actuating mechanism in micropump biomedical microelectromechanical systems (BioMEMS). Magnetic alginate films were fabricated in three steps: the co-precipitation of iron salts in an alkaline environment to obtain magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4), the mixing of the obtained nanoparticles with a sodium alginate solution containing glycerol as a plasticizer and folic acid as an active substance, and finally the casting of the final solution in a Petri dish followed by cross-linking with calcium chloride solution. Magnetite nanoparticles were incorporated in the alginate matrix because of the well-established biocompatibility of both materials, a property that would make the film convenient for implantable BioMEMS devices. The obtained film was analyzed in terms of its magnetic, structural, and morphological properties.

The materials obtained were characterized from a morphological and structural point of view through different analysis techniques. Through X-ray diffraction (XRD), the crystallization plane and the ordered structure of the mesoporous silica were observed. The difference between the two types of materials containing MCM-41 and MCM-48 was observed through the different morphologies of the silica particles through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and also through the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) analysis, that the surface areas and volumes of pores was different between the two types of mesoporous silica, and, after loading with polyphenols, the values were reduced. The characteristic bands of silica and of polyphenols were easily observed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and, through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the residual mass was determined and the estimated amount of polyphenol in the materials and the efficient loading of mesoporous silica with polyphenols could be determined. The in vitro study was performed in two types of simulated biological fluids with different pH—simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF).

Purity, surface defects, size, and morphology of the nanoparticles are the main factors that influence the antimicrobial properties. In this study, we are comparing the properties of the ZnO nanoparticles obtained by solvolysis using a series of alcohols: primary from methanol to 1-hexanol, secondary (2-propanol and 2-butanol), and tertiary (tert-butanol). While the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles is successfully accomplished in all primary alcohols, the use of secondary or tertiary alcohols does not lead to ZnO as final product, underlining the importance of the used solvent. The shape of the obtained nanoparticles depends on the alcohol used, from quasi-spherical to rods, and consequently, different properties are reported, including photocatalytic and antimicrobial activities. In the photocatalytic study, the ZnO obtained in 1-butanol exhibited the best performance against methylene blue (MB) dye solution, attaining a degradation efficiency of 98.24%. The comparative study among a series of usual model dyes revealed that triarylmethane dyes are less susceptible to photo-degradation.

However, numerous disadvantages limit the use of lipid nanoparticles in clinical settings, especially in bone regeneration, such as challenges in transporting, storing, and maintaining drug concentration in the local area. Scaffolds are frequently employed as implants to provide mechanical support to the damaged area or as diagnostic and imaging tools.

Here, we used polyethylene glycol-encapsulated iron oxide nanoparticles for the controlled delivery of a doxorubicin chemotherapeutic substance (IONPDOX), and to enhance cytotoxicity of photon radiation therapy. The biological effects of nanoparticles and 150 kV X-rays were evaluated on both 2D and 3D cell models of normal human keratinocytes (HaCaT) and tumor cells—human cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) and human squamous carcinoma (FaDu)—through cell survival. In all 2D cell models, nanoparticles were similarly internalized in a peri-nuclear pattern, but resulted in different survival capabilities following radiation treatment. IONP on normal keratinocytes showed a protective effect, but a cytotoxic effect for cancer cells. In 3D tumor cell models, IONPDOX were able to penetrate the cell spheroids towards the hypoxic areas. However, IONPDOX and 150 kV X-rays led to a dose-modifying factor DMFSF=0.1 = 1.09 ± 0.1 (200 µg/mL IONPDOX) in HeLa spheroids, but to a radioprotective effect in FaDu spheroids. Results show that the proposed treatment is promising in the management of cervical adenocarcinoma.</jats:p>\n",
      "Given the demanding use of controlled drug delivery systems, our attention was focused on developing a magnetic film that can be triggered in the presence of a magnetic field for both drug delivery and the actuating mechanism in micropump biomedical microelectromechanical systems (BioMEMS). Magnetic alginate films were fabricated in three steps: the co-precipitation of iron salts in an alkaline environment to obtain magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4), the mixing of the obtained nanoparticles with a sodium alginate solution containing glycerol as a plasticizer and folic acid as an active substance, and finally the casting of the final solution in a Petri dish followed by cross-linking with calcium chloride solution. Magnetite nanoparticles were incorporated in the alginate matrix because of the well-established biocompatibility of both materials, a property that would make the film convenient for implantable BioMEMS devices. The obtained film was analyzed in terms of its magnetic, structural, and morphological properties. To demonstrate the hypothesis that the magnetic field can be used to trigger drug release from the films, we studied the release profile in an aqueous medium (pH= 8) using a NdFeB magnet as a triggering factor.\n",

      "In modern dentistry, the application of resinbased composites continues to increase, and in the majority of countries has completely replaced mercury amalgams [1]. This trend is generated by government legislation regarding the application of products that contain mercury and by their esthetic quality, fast and on-demand setting process, excellent physic-mechanical properties and for the chemical bonding potential with tooth tissue [2]. However, because of the differences related to chemical bonding of these materials, the interaction is very weak at the interface leading to no significant values in practical situations. For these reasons, the surface modification of inorganic particles appears as an efficient technique to overcome the incompatibility and improve interactions between polymer matrix and nanoparticles. Such approach is expected to lead to a homogenous distribution of the filler as well as better properties for polymer composites [3]. Alumina (Al2O3) is a representative bioinert ceramic with a variety of applications in industry as well as in medicine [4]. Alumina has the potential to improve electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity of polymers [5, 6].

      "New packaging materials based on biopolymers are gaining increasing attention due to many advantages like biodegradability or existence of renewable sources. Grouping more antimicrobials agents in the same packaging can create a synergic effect, resulting in either a better antimicrobial activity against a wider spectrum of spoilage agents or a lower required quantity of antimicrobials. In the present work, we obtained a biodegradable antimicrobial film that can be used as packaging material for food. Films based on chitosan as biodegradable polymer, with ZnO and Ag nanoparticles as filler/antimicrobial agents were fabricated by a casting method. The nanoparticles were loaded with citronella essential oil (CEO) in order to enhance the antimicrobial activity of the nanocomposite films. The tests made on Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and fungal strains indicated a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, with inhibition diameters of over 30 mm for bacterial strains and over 20 mm for fungal strains. The synergic effect was evidenced by comparing the antimicrobial results with chitosan/ZnO/CEO or chitosan/Ag/CEO simple films. According to the literature and our preliminary studies, these formulations are suitable as coating for fruits. The obtained nanocomposite films presented lower water vapor permeability values when compared with the chitosan control film.

      "The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation behaviours of the YNi3.5Al0.5Mg compound were studied by in situ X-ray diffraction under hydrogen pressure and at room temperature. The changes of (i) the lattice parameters, (ii) the crystallite size and (iii) the lattice strain during the sorption process (i.e. along the PC isotherms) were studied. These results indicate that the crystallite size decreases by a factor of 2. The micro deformations increase at first and then tend to almost zero at the end of the sorption cycle. This behaviour is explained in terms of co-existence of the metal (i.e. α phase) and metal hydride (i.e. β phase) phases. The change in crystallinity is consistent with the hydrogen induced amorphisation process existing in a lot of AB2 compounds. No anisotropic effects can be highlighted on this pseudo-AB2 compounds in contrary with what could be observed in AB5 compounds.\n",

      "Diseases or complications that are caused by bone tissue damage affect millions of patients every year. Orthopedic and dental implants have become important treatment options for replacing and repairing missing or damaged parts of bones and teeth. In order to use a material in the manufacture of implants, the material must meet several requirements, such as mechanical stability, elasticity, biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, corrosion resistance, and non-toxicity. In the 1970s, a biocompatible glassy material called bioactive glass was discovered. At a later time, several glass materials with similar properties were developed. This material has a big potential to be used in formulating medical devices, but its fragility is an important disadvantage. The use of bioactive glasses in the form of coatings on metal substrates allows the combination of the mechanical hardness of the metal and the biocompatibility of the bioactive glass. In this review, an extensive study of the literature was conducted regarding the preparation methods of bioactive glass and the different techniques of coating on various substrates, such as stainless steel, titanium, and their alloys.

We study the influence of alcohol type (n-butanol, ethylene glycol and glycerin) on the size, morphology, and properties of the obtained ZnO NPs. The smallest polyhedral ZnO NPs (&lt;30 nm) were obtained in n-butanol, while in ethylene glycol the NPs measured on average 44 nm and were rounded. Polycrystalline particles of 120 nm were obtained in glycerin only after water refluxing. In addition, here, we report the photocatalytic activity, against a dye mixture, of three model pollutants: methyl orange (MO), methylene blue (MB), and rhodamine B (RhB), a model closer to real situations where water is polluted with many chemicals. All samples exhibited good photocatalytic activity against the dye mixture, with degradation efficiency reaching 99.99%. The sample with smallest nanoparticles maintained a high efficiency &gt;90%, over five catalytic cycles. Antibacterial tests were conducted against Gram-negative strains Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, and Gram-positive strains Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus. The ZnO samples presented strong inhibition of planktonic growth for all tested strains, indicating that they can be used for antibacterial applications, such as water purification.</jats:p>\n",
      "Numerous studies have reported the possibility of enhancing the properties of materials by incorporating foreign elements within their crystal lattice. In this context, while magnetite has widely known properties that have been used for various biomedical applications, the introduction of other metals within its structure could prospectively enhance its effectiveness. Specifically, zinc and cerium have demonstrated their biomedical potential through significant antioxidant, anticancer, and antimicrobial features. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to develop a series of zinc and/or cerium-substituted magnetite nanoparticles that could further be used in the medical sector. The nanostructures were synthesized through the co-precipitation method and their morpho-structural characteristics were evaluated through X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses. Furthermore, the nanostructures were subjected to a ROS-Glo H2O2 assay for assessing their antioxidant potential, MTT assay for determining their anticancer effects, and antimicrobial testing against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans strains. Results have proven promising for future biomedical applications, as the nanostructures inhibit oxidative stress in normal cells, with between two- and three-fold reduction and cell proliferation in tumor cells; a two-fold decrease in cell viability and microbial growth; an inhibition zone diameter of 4–6 mm and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1–2 mg/mL.\n",
      "<jats:p>The aim of the present study was to obtain a hydrogel-based film as a carrier for the sustained and controlled release of vancomycin, an antibiotic commonly used in various types of infections. Considering the high-water solubility of vancomycin (&gt;50 mg/mL) and the aqueous medium underlying the exudates, a prolonged release of vancomycin from an MCM-41 carrier was sought. The present work focused on the synthesis of malic acid coated magnetite (Fe3O4/malic) by co-precipitation, synthesis of MCM-41 by a sol-gel method and loading of MCM-41 with vancomycin, and their use in alginate films for wound dressing. The nanoparticles obtained were physically mixed and embedded in the alginate gel. Prior to incorporation, the nanoparticles were characterized by XRD, FT-IR and FT-Raman spectroscopy, TGA-DSC and DLS. The films were prepared by a simple casting method and were further cross-linked and examined for possible heterogeneities by means of FT-IR microscopy and SEM. The degree of swelling and the water vapor transmission rate were determined, considering their potential use as wound dressings. The obtained films show morpho-structural homogeneity, sustained release over 48 h and a strong synergistic enhancement of the antimicrobial activity as a consequence of the hybrid nature of these films. The antimicrobial efficacy was tested against S. aureus, two strains of E. faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, VRE) and C. albicans. The incorporation of magnetite was also considered as an external triggering component in case the films were used as a magneto-responsive smart dressing to stimulate vancomycin diffusion.</jats:p>\n",
      "The annually necessary human bone grafts are in continuous grown due to the increasing offractals, congenital and non-congenital diseases. Based on statistical reports (Murugan andRamakrishna 2005), only in USA about 6.3 million fractures occur every year and about550.000 of these require bone grafting. The most frequently fractures occur at the level ofhip, ankle, tibia and fibula. Due to the higher physical effort, the men are more exposed tofracture than women (2.8% in the case of men comparing to 2.0% in the case of women). Thenumber of fractures increases year by year and consequently many researchers fromdifferent research fields co-operate in order to develop new bone graft materials. Also, it isimportant to mention that, in the present, the bone diseases are overlapped only by hearthdiseases.The history of bone grafting is starting in 1913 when Dr. D.E. Robertson assays a piece ofcat’s bone and a piece of human bone for bone grafting into dogs (Gallie and Toronto 1914).The microscopic analysis of implanted graft after 20 days shows that the space between graftand living bone is filled with new cancellous bone. These early works made the premises forthe development of the bone grafts.Due to the increasing of the necessarily bone grafts, autografts and allografts can not coverthe overall need of bone grafts. For compensate this gap, artificial (synthetic) grafts arenecessary and, consequently used. The use of synthetic grafts has some advantages versusallografts, autografts and xenografts: the possibility to obtain unlimited number/quantity ofsynthetic grafts, more safety use of artificial bone grafts without disease transmission risk,pain limitation by elimination of some secondary surgical intervention. \n",

      "In this paper we describe the synthesis of a core-shell material using yttrium superconducting ceramic material (YBCO) and cobalt ferrite nanoparticles in order to obtain a nanostructured material with magnetic properties. The advantages of such material aim the selective deposition of nanofilms oriented in magnetic fields. To obtain this core-shell material, the solutions of the nitrates were first obtained by dissolving the salts in demineralised water. The suspension with cobalt ferrite nanoparticles was obtained by co-precipitation method. To obtain YBa2Cu3O7-a-coated magnetic nanoparticles by autocombustion reaction the solutions of nitrates and citric acid were used. The ratio of the metal ions: Y: Ba: Cu was 1: 2: 3, and between the oxidant and the reducing agent was used a citrate/nitrate mass ratio equal with 0.7. The final material was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), electronic scanning microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM).\n",
      "<jats:p>In this research, Hydroxyapatite—Potassium, Sodium Niobate—Chitosan (HA-KNN-CSL) biocomposites were synthesized, both as hydrogel and ultra-porous scaffolds, to offer two commonly used alternatives to biomaterials in dental clinical practice. The biocomposites were obtained by varying the content of low deacetylated chitosan as matrix phase, mesoporous hydroxyapatite nano-powder, and potassium–sodium niobate (K0.47Na0.53NbO3) sub-micron-sized powder. The resulting materials were characterized from physical, morpho-structural, and in vitro biological points of view. The porous scaffolds were obtained by freeze-drying the composite hydrogels and had a specific surface area of 18.4—24 m2/g and a strong ability to retain fluid. Chitosan degradation was studied for 7 and 28 days of immersion in simulated body fluid without enzymatic presence. All synthesized compositions proved to be biocompatible in contact with osteoblast-like MG-63 cells and showed antibacterial effects. The best antibacterial effect was shown by the 10HA-90KNN-CSL hydrogel composition against Staphylococcus aureus and the fungal strain Candida albicans, while a weaker effect was observed for the dry scaffold.</jats:p>\n",
      "<jats:p>Since cancer is a continuously increasing concern for the general population, more efficient treatment alternatives ought to be developed. In this regard, a promising direction is represented by the use of magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) to act both as a nanocarrier for the targeted release of antitumoral drugs and as hyperthermia agents. Thus, the present study focused on improving the control upon the outcome properties of MNPs by using two synthesis methods, namely the co-precipitation and microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, for the incorporation of usnic acid (UA), a natural lichen-derived metabolite with proven anticancer activity. The obtained UA-loaded MNPs were thoroughly characterized regarding their morpho-structural and physicochemical properties through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). Results demonstrated the formation of magnetite as the unique mineralogical phase through both types of synthesis, with increased uniformity regarding the drug loading efficiency, size, stability, and magnetic properties obtained through the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of the nanostructures against the HEK 293T cell line was investigated through the XTT assay, which further proved their potential for anticancer treatment applications.</jats:p>\n",
      "<jats:p>Bone tissue engineering has attracted great interest in the last few years, as the frequency of tissue-damaging or degenerative diseases has increased exponentially. To obtain an ideal treatment solution, researchers have focused on the development of optimum biomaterials to be applied for the enhancement of bioactivity and the regeneration process, which are necessary to support the proper healing process of osseous tissues. In this regard, hydroxyapatite (HA) has been the most widely used material in the biomedical field due to its great biocompatibility and similarity with the native apatite from the human bone. However, HA still presents some deficiencies related to its mechanical properties, which are essential for HA to be applied in load-bearing applications. Bioactivity is another vital property of HA and is necessary to further improve regeneration and antibacterial activity. These drawbacks can be solved by doping the material with trace elements, adapting the properties of the material, and, finally, sustaining bone regeneration without the occurrence of implant failure. Considering these aspects, in this review, we have presented some general information about HA properties, synthesis methods, applications, and the necessity for the addition of doping ions into its structure. Also, we have presented their influence on the properties of HA, as well as the latest applications of doped materials in the biomedical field.</jats:p>\n",
      "<jats:p>This review article explores the multiple applications and potential of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in the biomedical field. With their highly versatile and tunable properties, MOFs present many possibilities, including drug delivery, biomolecule recognition, biosensors, and immunotherapy. Their crystal structure allows precise tuning, with the ligand typology and metal geometry playing critical roles. MOFs’ ability to encapsulate drugs and exhibit pH-triggered release makes them ideal candidates for precision medicine, including cancer treatment. They are also potential gene carriers for genetic disorders and have been used in biosensors and as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging. Despite the complexities encountered in modulating properties and interactions with biological systems, further research on MOFs is imperative. The primary focus of this review is to provide a comprehensive examination of MOFs in these applications, highlighting the current achievements and complexities encountered.

      "Functionalized magnetic nanoparticles are used in several biomedical applications, such as drug delivery, magnetic cell separation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast agents for diagnostics. Although there are several kinds of interesting magnetic nanoparticles, iron-oxide particle magnetite (Fe2O3) and its oxidized form maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) have attracted more attention because they are non-toxic and less susceptible to change due to oxidation. These facts make this kind of nanoparticles one of the most studied materials for biomedical applications [1-2]. The study of nanoscale magnetic materials domains is of both fundamental and pressing technical interest as the grain size of advanced recording media is rapidly shrinking to dimensions where as an example the magnetic properties depend strongly on nanocrystal size [3] with their characteristic size in the range 1-100 nanometers. The diagnostic and therapeutic applications of magnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (MNP) are underlined above expanded enormously in the past decades. Magnetic resonance imaging\n",
      "In drug therapy, it is important to provide therapeutic levels of drug to the site of action (or at least in the blood) and maintain them during the treatment [1]. Furthermore, it is desirable to minimize temporal variations in drug concentration by using modified drug delivery systems (MDDS) to avoid periods of over-dosing or under-dosing. The modifications involve changes in the rate and/or time and/or site of drug release in comparison with conventional formulations by delaying drug release (extended release systems), targeting drug release (site-specific release systems), prevention or reduction of side effects, taste masking or improving drug solubility. New strategies are focused on increasing drug stability and on simultaneously modifying drug delivery patterns (particulate delivery systems)[2]. These changes are achievable by several possible mechanisms, including modifications in pharmaceutical formulations and/or method of preparation. Clay minerals (layered silicates) have been proposed as fundamental constituents of several MDDS, with different purposes and acting through various mechanisms [3]. The intercalation of organic species into layered inorganic materials provides a useful and convenient route to prepare organic-inorganic hybrids that combine the properties of both inorganic host and organic guest [4, 5]. A very interesting possibility is to use clay mineral polymer composites to modify drug release. Although clay minerals and polymers are frequently used as single drug carriers, this type of drug delivery system (DDS) often does not meet all requirements. Preparation of polymer layered silicate composite offers the possibility of \n",

The dried gels were individually heated at a rate of 5 C/min up to 600 C, 800 C, and 1000 C. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used for to characterize the composition, morphology and particle size of samples. At 800 C a small amount of CaO (about 0.3 wt%) was detected in which increased after annealing at 1000 C (about 1.1 wt%). The crystallites are elongated along the c crystallographic axis, but the size anisotropy decreases with increasing temperature above 800 C. The size along the elongation axis increased from 43 nm at 80 C to about 143 nm at 1000 C, as determined by XRD, and from 120 to 280 nm, as measured by TEM.

      "Zinc oxide like many semiconductors has various technical applications [1-13], but it is also used in a series of cosmetic preparates, sun protection cream, acne treatment or as a wound dressing [14-24]. Application of zinc oxide has been shown to accelerate the healing of both chronic and acute wounds and it also exhibit antibacterial and anti-inflammatory behaviour [25, 26]. ZnO effect on epithelialisation of wounds as well as its bacteriostatic property promotes it as a topical wound dressing. It can be used in treatment of various dermatitis, diaper rashes, diaper wipes, blisters, and open skin sores [27-30]. As different bacterial strains become increasingly resistant to antibiotics, the search for new strategies to deal with the diseases causing bacteria intensifies. Researchers need to identify and develop the next generation of drugs or agents to control bacterial infections [31-43]. Another major concern is related to the growth of fungal pathogens. It is difficult to control fungal growth because fungi have developed resistance to many conventional fungicides such as benzimidazoles and dicarboximides. To overcome this resistance, it is important to explore novel antifungal agents, which may replace current control strategies [44-50]. The antibacterial effect of adhesive zinc tapes on streptococci and staphylococci were described by Gilje as early as 1949 [51]. In dentistry, the antibacterial effects of zinc oxide have been reported [52]. In a study by Sodeberg et al.[53], it was found that Gram-positive bacteria were the most susceptible bacterial group to zinc ion and Gram-negative aerobic bacteria were usually not inhibited.

      "Semiconductor nanoparticles have attracted interests of many academic and industrial researchers because of their unusual optoelectronic properties [1-4]. Nanosized ZnO can be utilized in electrochemical fields including chemical sensors [5], photocatalysts [6, 7], thin films [8, 9], dye-sensitized solar cells [10] and in various optoelectronic devices as well as in spintronics [11]. ZnO is a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 3.37 eV having an excitonic binding energy of 60 meV. The literature is abundant in reports of ZnO photoluminescence. The photoluminescence spectra of ZnO powders usually presents two emission peaks in the UV and visible ranges [12], the relative intensity of which strongly depended on O2 pressure used during the synthesis process [13]. These luminescence effects have been assigned to electronic transitions involving the conduction band, the valence band, and various intrinsic or extrinsic defect levels lying within the band gap.\n",

      "With the recent progress in the microwave communication systems, microwave dielectric ceramics have become very important for the miniaturization of microwave devices such as filters or antennas [1, 2]. Ba (Mg1/3Ta2/3) O3 (BMT) ceramic possesses excellent dielectric properties: high quality factor (Q f> 400 THz), moderate dielectric constant (εr~ 25) and small temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (τf< 5 ppm/C), for microwave applications. BMT can have a disordered cubic complex perovskite structure with 1: 1 cationic order or a long range ordered (LRO), 1: 2 type, trigonal structure. The microwave quality factor of BMT ceramic material depends, especially, on the LRO, with repeated sequence-Mg-Ta-Ta- of cations on the perovskite B-site [1, 3, 4]. Because the sinterability of BMT is poor even at high temperatures of 1600 C, many investigations have been carried out to reduce the sintering temperature of BMT ceramic without deteriorating to much the microwave dielectric properties. Several authors reported improvement in sinterability by the use of sintering aids or dopants [1, 5]. Although they succeeded in improving the dielectric properties of BMT, sintering temperature remained above 1600 C in most cases. In this paper, the synthesis of undoped and doped BMT sintered pellets is reported. Nb2O5, V2O5 and Ga2O3 were added in small quantities ( 1 mol%) in order to improve the Q f product value of BMT ceramic. Different sintering temperatures, in the range (1550-1650) C, were applied.

      "The main problem of IT-SOFCs is the severe requirements that the electrolytes used have to satisfy, which among others are the following:(a) phase stability in both reducing and oxidising atmospheres for long periods of time in service ( 5000 h);(b) high and stable electrical conductivity ( 10-2 S cm-1) at the fuel cell operating temperature; and (c) relatively high mechanical properties (σ 500Mpa at room temperature and KIC 3Mpa m1/2). Zirconia ceramics containing 3 mol% of Y2O3 and having a tetragonal structure,(Y-TZP) are currently being used, because of their strength and fracture toughness. However, at present there are two main problems with this kind of electrolyte: its low ionic conductivity at the SOFC operating temperature and, on the other hand, its very bad ageing behaviour, given the metastability of the tetragonal zirconia solid solutions. Although zirconia ceramics containing between 3 and 6.5 mol% Y2O3 (Y-PSZ) presented better ageing behaviour and higher ionic conductivity, these properties could be seriously affected by the characteristics and annealing behaviour of a dual (tetragonal+ cubic) microstructure, typical for these kinds of zirconia ceramics. Fully stabilised zirconia (FSZ), with a cubic structure, containing 6.5 and 10 mol% Y2O3, is the most attractive zirconia ceramic to be used as an electrolyte in SOFC systems, due to its improved electrical properties.

      "Diseases or complications that are caused by bone tissue damage affect millions of patients every year. Orthopedic and dental implants have become important treatment options for replacing and repairing missing or damaged parts of bones and teeth. In order to use a material in the manufacture of implants, the material must meet several requirements, such as mechanical stability, elasticity, biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, corrosion resistance, and non-toxicity. In the 1970s, a biocompatible glassy material called bioactive glass was discovered. At a later time, several glass materials with similar properties were developed. This material has a big potential to be used in formulating medical devices, but its fragility is an important disadvantage. The use of bioactive glasses in the form of coatings on metal substrates allows the combination of the mechanical hardness of the metal and the biocompatibility of the bioactive glass. In this review, an extensive study of the literature was conducted regarding the preparation methods of bioactive glass and the different techniques of coating on various substrates, such as stainless steel, titanium, and their alloys. Furthermore, the main doping agents that can be used to impart special properties to the bioactive glass coatings are described.\n",

Their mechanical, structural properties and long term behaviour in simulated body fluid (SBF) were analysed. Also, these scaffolds were subjected to in vitro evaluation of cell behaviour. The open porosity from 16.41% to 34.26% it resulted. The compression resistance (2-3 MPa) is very close to the cancellous bone.

      "The aim of this paper is the obtaining of final dense ceramics starting from zirconia powders. In the first step, zirconia powders were prepared through sol-gel method, using different amounts of CaO: 6, 7 and 8 mol%. After synthesis, the powders were dried at 100 degrees C and then heat treated at 700 degrees C for 3 hours. In the second step, zirconia ceramics were obtained. The powders were uniaxially pressed, followed by HIP - hot isostatic pressing at temperatures of 1200 degrees C and 1300 degrees C, for 1 hour, under 150 MPa, in an argon atmosphere. After HIP, the samples were morphologically and structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In this step were also studied ceramic properties like density, compressive strength and Young's modulus.\n",
      "Drug delivery systems (DDS) are new tools with applications both in the fields of industry and medicine. Drug delivery is a domain of high importance for medicine and healthcare [1-6]. A wide range of improvements can occur by controlling drug delivery: bioavailability, by preventing premature degradation and enhancing uptake, the number of side effects will decrease by targeting exactly the diseased cells and sites, and a constant drug concentration by controlling the drug release rate. Many synthetic biomaterials were tested as bone graft materials but the most promising of them seems to be the collagen (Coll)/hydroxyapatite (HA)(nano) composite materials because because of the similarity with natural bones [7-9].

      "In order to obtain phosphate biomaterials, non-conventional wet-chemical methods are generally used. Therefore in this work the spray-pyrolysis method was chosen. For this purpose, calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (Ca (NO3)(2) center dot 4H (2) O) and triethyl phosphate (C6H15O4P) were used as raw materials. By optimizing the spray-pyrolysis synthesis parameters, hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanopowders were prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures ranged between 600 and 1000 degrees C. The thermal behavior of the precursors was investigated by thermal analysis methods (TG-DTG). The HAp nanopowders were characterized from phase composition, chemical and morphological point of view by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

      "Epitaxial High-Critical Temperature Superconducting thin films are obtained by pulsed laser deposition only at very high substrate temperatures ( 780 C) and using post-deposition treatments, which restrict their applicability and common substrates integration possibilities. In this work, we report on YBa2Cu3O7-δ epitaxial thin films growth at two different substrate temperatures, the classic 780 oC and 730 oC. The layers have been deposited by pulsed laser deposition. For lower deposition temperature experiments (730 0C), a radio-frequency oxygen plasma discharge working at 200 W has been added. Morphological (atomic force microscopy), structural (X-ray diffraction), optical (spectrometric ellipsometry) and electrical investigations have been performed for films characterization, as well as AC magnetic susceptibility measurements.

      "ZrO 2-Al 2 O 3 composites were prepared by coprecipitation starting from the corresponding chlorides(zirconia was fully stabilised using 8 wt% Y 2 O 3). In order to obtain ceramic composites with a high relative density(> 99%), different oxides such as ZnO, CuO, MnO 2 and TiO 2(2 wt%) were added. Uniaxially pressed green bodies were sintered at various temperatures between 1400 and 1600 C, holding at the highest temperature in each case for 3 h. For bodies sintered at 1500 C, the soaking time was varied from 3 to 6 h. The microstructure and phase composition of the composites were determined by SEM and XRD. The compressive strength and Young's modulus were also determined. The results showed that the nature of the oxide additive and the sintering temperature are key factors controlling the mechanical behaviour of the composites.\n",
      "In medical applications where bone ingrowth is intended it is beneficial to have bioresorbable phase like beta tricalcium phosphate, as this phase are know to be more soluble than HAP. Tricalcium phosphate Ca3 (PO4) 2 (β-TCP), an osteoconductive as well as bioresorbable ceramic, has found applications as bone cement and bone implant material, respectively.[1-4] This ceramics may by used in granular, dense or porous form. In recent years, attention was particularly placed on the fabrication of β-TCP with porous configuration because the porous network allows the tissue to infiltrate, which further enhances the implant-tissue attachment.[1] The most currently used production method for these foam structures is the polymeric sponge technique wherein soft polyurethane foams (PU-foam) is dipped into ceramic slurry. After elimination of the excess slurry and drying, the Pu-foams are burnt off and, after sintering, ceramic foams are obtained. This method has the advantage that the cell size of such structures are be easily adapted by starting from another PU-foam having the appropriate cell size. The proprieties of the ceramic slurries are crucial for the characteristics of the foams. Firstly, they should have high content of solids, in order to reduce the shrinkage during firing, good homogeneity and must be stable in time. In this work, in order to obtain stable slurry with solid content of 65wt% was used different additives like dispersant agents and binder. The binder provides strength to the ceramic structure after drying prevents collapse during sponge volatilization and promote the optimal polymeric sponge structure cover; a binder previously tested \n",

We reported the influence of thermal contact conditions of the substrates during deposition on growth of SBN: 50 thin layers. For unsecured thermal contact of substrates, the morphology of SBN: 50 thin films show large grains and relatively high roughness.

      "Calcium doped strontium barium niobate Sr0.5Ba0.5Nb2O6 (SBN:50) is a tungsten bronze ferroelectric material with a tetragonal unit cell. SrxCayBa1-x-yNb2O6 (SCBN) compositions with (x = 0.5; y = 0.14 and 0.28) were obtained by solid-state reaction method. The phase structure, microstructure and dielectric properties of obtained SCBN ceramics were systematically investigated. XRD results showed that SCBN phase with tungsten bronze structure could be obtained in all ceramic samples. Higher Ca content (y = 0.28) lead to occurrence of a secondary phase of CaNb2O6. SEM micrographs show the formation of crystallites with sharp boundaries with an average grain size of about 4 divided by 12 pm for all SCBN compositions. Compared with pure SBN:50 composition, Ca doping results in a reduction of the dielectric constant value, but the dielectric losses are found to be smaller for this compositions.\n",

      "In recent years, the demand for dielectric resonators has been increasing owing to their usage in wireless communications. In this regard, microwave dielectric ceramics are helpful due to their technologically congruent properties, as well as the intrinsic ability of reduced component sizes. There are three important parameters that a dielectric resonator material should have, so that it can meet the desired requirements: a high dielectric constant (εr), a low loss at microwave frequencies (usually expressed as a high Q f value) and a near-zero value of the temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency (τf). These are essential for a stable resonant frequency, possible miniaturization of the device and temperature stabile circuits, respectively.[1, 2] BaMg1/3Ta2/3O3 (BMT) ceramic has a complex perovskite structure and shows Q f values up to 400 THz at frequencies close to 10 GHz [2]. A compromise on the microwave dielectric properties is made by replacing tantalum with less expensive niobium ions. The common method for preparation of BMT-based ceramics is the conventional solid-state reaction method. However, in order to achieve very good dielectric properties, this method requires high sintering temperature (~ 1600 C) and long annealing time (~ 100 h)[2]. Several authors reported improvement in sinterability by using sintering aids or dopants or by adding glasses [2, 3].\n",

An additional annealing at 1 400 C for 10 hours was performed in order to improve the dielectric parameters. The best parameters were achieved for the samples sintered at 1 600 C with additional thermal treatment.\n",

Impurities substituting the cations in the host perovskite lattice caused, on the one hand, the shift of paraelectric ferroelectric phase transition towards lower temperature values,\n",
      "In this paper we describe the synthesis of a core-shell material using yttrium superconducting ceramic material (YBCO) and cobalt ferrite nanoparticles in order to obtain a nanostructured material with magnetic properties. The advantages of such material aim the selective deposition of nanofilms oriented in magnetic fields. To obtain this core-shell material, the solutions of the nitrates were first obtained by dissolving the salts in demineralised water. The suspension with cobalt ferrite nanoparticles was obtained by co-precipitation method. To obtain YBa2Cu3O7-a-coated magnetic nanoparticles by autocombustion reaction the solutions of nitrates and citric acid were used. The ratio of the metal ions: Y: Ba: Cu was 1: 2: 3, and between the oxidant and the reducing agent was used a citrate/nitrate mass ratio equal with 0.7.
