Various alloys have been chosen due to their biocompatibility, such as: stainless steels, titanium alloys and nickel or cobalt alloys. According to the alloying elements it is possible to change the material properties to fit into various application niches such as pacemaker devices, stents, biosensors, dental or bone implants and others. Some alloying elements confer higher biocompatibility than others and the commonly used alloys include elements that can be detrimental to human health such as Nickel, Vanadium and Cobalt. Choosing alloying elements such as Nb, Fe and Zr in order to replace the commonly used metals reduces the risks of accumulation of various substances that can damage the human tissues and lead to health complications. The proposed alloys are elaborated in a Five Celes melting furnace under argon atmosphere in order to create a more homogeneous material with lesser defects and inclusions.

Maximum adsorption of Cr (VI) was achieved under acidic pH (pH= 4) after a contact time of approximately 120 minutes. The activated charcoal was treated in order to vary the pH from acid to base so that its influence on the removal of the metal ions could be investigated. In order to study possible structural changes of the treatment material (activated charcoal), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and UV-VIS molecular adsorption spectrometer, before and after adsorption of Cr (VI) was investigated in detail to validate the adsorption of the heavy metal. Detailed investigation included the effects of initial concentration, adsorbent dose, contact time, pH of solution for the adsorption process and the evaluation of optimum conditions required for a high yield of Cr (VI) removal.

367,8200,"Characterization of Magnetic Nanoiron Oxides for the Removal of Metal Ions from Aqueous Solution","characterization magnetic nanoiron oxide removal metal ion aqueous solution",en,"Two nanostructured hybrid materials are reported that include uncoated magnetic nanoiron oxides and magnetic nanoiron oxides treated with rose leaf extract. Atomic and molecular absorption spectrometry were used to evaluate the sensitivity of these materials for the isolation of Cr(VI), Zn(II), Pb(II), and Ca(II) from aqueous solution. The structure and physicochemical properties of the resulting nanohybrids were characterized by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The results show that following 15 min of contact in acidic solution, the uncoated magnetic nanoiron oxides removed approximately 90% of Cr(VI), while the magnetic nanoiron oxides coated with rose leaf extract removed 92% of the analyte. These correspond to most industrial wastewater conditions. For the removal of Ca(II) and Zn(II), it was necessary to adjust the pH to neutral to maximize the efficiency.

Word2Vec is a powerful and one of the newest Natural Language Processing semantic models used for computing text cohesion and similarity between documents. This research considers cohesion scores in terms of the strength of the semantic relations established between two utterances; the higher the score, the stronger the similarity between two utterances. An implicit link is established based on cohesion to the most similar previous utterance, within an imposed window. Three similarity formulas were used to compute the cohesion score: an unnormalized score, a normalized score with distance and Mihalce a's formula. Our corpus of conversations incorporated explicit references provided by authors, which were used for validation. A window of 5 utterances and a 1 minute time frame provided the highest detection rate both for exact matching and matching of a block of continuous utterances belonging to the same speaker. Moreover, the unnormalized score correctly identified the largest number of implicit links.","paper present research use word2vec determine implicit link multi participant computer support collaborative learning conversation word2vec be powerful new natural language processing semantic model use compute text cohesion similarity document research consider cohesion score term strength semantic relation establish utterance high score strong similarity utterance implicit link be establish base cohesion most similar previous utterance impose window similarity formula be use compute cohesion score unnormalized score normalize score distance mihalce s formula corpus conversation incorporate explicit reference provide author be use validation window utterance minute time frame provide high detection rate exact matching matching block continuous utterance belong same speaker moreover unnormalized score correctly identify large number implicit link",en,5,proceedings-article,10.1109/icalt.2017.120,000427129000060,word2vec;research;links;semantic;provided;conversations;matching;established;unnormalized;window;implicit;similarity;utterances;cohesion;score,"word2vec research link semantic provide conversation match establish unnormalized window implicit similarity utterance cohesion score",en,"Gabriel, Gutu; Mihai, Dascalu; Stefan, Ruseti; Traian, Rebedea; Stefan, Trausan-Matu",NULL,"implicit link,link,utterance,score,cohesion,unnormalized score,implicit link in multi participant computer,link in multi,large number of implicit link,natural language processing semantic model,cohesion score in term,block of continuous utterance,new natural language processing,research,multi,similarity,similarity between document,score with distance,corpus of conversation,window of utterance,power of wordvec,minute time frame,high detection rate,similar previous utterance,language,similarity formula,exact matching,collaborative learning,semantic model,text cohesion,semantic relation,s formula,explicit reference,same speaker,link in multi participant,processing,model,participant,language processing,natural language,implicit link in multi,paper,wordvec,computer,conversation,strength,window,formula,author,validation,matching,processing semantic model",en

In this paper we explore possibilities for interactive natural language dialogue in a serious game by combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with dialogue management. Our game learning environment has a communication scenario editor in which a domain expert develops a structured, scripted scenario as a sequence of potential interactions. A communication scenario is context-specific and often follows a protocol - for instance, delivering bad news to a patient. Currently, a player navigates through a simulation and converses with a virtual character by choosing a statement option from one of the prescripted player statements, at each step in the simulation. We develop a scenario-specific corpus method (SSCM) to process open responses (i.e. natural language inputs) in our learning environment. We conduct an experiment to collect data for comparing SSCM against multiple NLP methods, and another experiment to investigate if framing can improve processing open-text input using SSCM in a communication simulation.","serious game often employ pre script dialogue interaction player contrast free user input enable deep immersion paper explore possibility interactive natural language dialogue serious game combine natural language processing nlp technique dialogue management game learning environment have communication scenario editor domain expert develop structured scripted scenario sequence potential interaction communication scenario be context specific often follow protocol instance deliver bad news patient currently player navigate simulation converse virtual character choose statement option prescripted player statement step simulation develop scenario specific corpus method sscm process open response i e natural language input learning environment conduct experiment collect data compare sscm multiple nlp method experiment investigate framing improve processing open text input use sscm communication simulation",en,10,proceedings-article,,NULL,"a communication scenario,a player,we,natural language","communication scenario player natural language",en,"JT, JEURING; Dascalu, MIHAI; Raja, LALA; FPM, HEEMSKERK; Marcell Van, GEEST; Jordy Van, DORTMONT; Gabriel, GUTU; Stefan, RUSETI; Beatrice, ALEX; Richard, TOBIN",NULL,"natural language,scenario,language,input,communication,communication scenario,serious game,dialogue,language processing nlp technique with dialogue,possibility for interactive natural language dialogue,processing,sscm,method,sscm against multiple nlp method,natural language processing nlp technique,scenario specific corpus method sscm,language processing,corpus,technique with dialogue management,sequence of potential interaction,processing open text input,corpus method,specific corpus,text,open text,game,player,simulation,experiment,player in contrast,protocol for instance,game learning environment,communication scenario editor,natural language input,open text input,scripted communication scenario,structured scripted scenario,user input,domain expert,statement option,player statement,text input,communication simulation,deep immersion,bad news,virtual character,open response,interaction,environment,language processing nlp,nlp,specific corpus method,interactive natural language,language dialogue,nlp technique,pre,paper,technique,patient,converse,statement,step,data,framing,corpus method sscm,natural language dialogue,natural language processing,scenario specific corpus",en

Thus, if the implementation of the project implies that the budget allocated to some activities has been underestimated or overestimated, then we have to deal with the question of a budgetary reallocation between the budget chapters of the project budget. Therefore, during the implementation of a project, project budget monitoring has to be made permanently through the project's cash-flow simulations and analyses. This paper has been developed within a project funded by the Sectoral Operational Program for Human Resources Development, a project implemented in partnership between two universities in Romania, over a period of 18 months. One of the major responsibilities of the project manager was the ongoing monitoring of the budget because the contractual clauses imposed major penalties if the percentage ratios between the main budget chapters of the project were not respected during the execution phase. The permanent monitoring of the project's cash flow resulted in a budget execution of approximately 96\% and the percentage execution budgets of the project to be respected among the categories of budget expenditures were within the limits imposed by the financing contract.","issue monitor project budget be major discuss about efficient project management thus implementation project imply budget allocate activity have be underestimate overestimate then have deal question budgetary reallocation budget chapter project budget therefore implementation project project budget monitoring have be make permanently project s cash flow simulation analyse paper have be develop project fund sectoral operational program human resource development project implement partnership university romania period month major responsibility project manager be ongoing monitoring budget contractual clause impose major penalty percentage ratio main budget chapter project be not respect execution phase permanent monitoring project s cash flow result budget execution approximately percentage execution budget project be respect category budget expenditure be limit impose financing contract",en,3,proceedings-article,10.1088/1757-899X/400/6/062026,000461147400168,imposed;percentage;cash;flow;budgets;chapters;implementation;respected;major;execution;monitoring;budget;project,"impose percentage cash flow budget chapter implementation respect major execution monitoring budget project",en,"M.

A communication scenario is context-specific and often follows a protocol-for instance, delivering bad news to a patient. Currently, a player navigates through a simulation and converses with a virtual character by choosing a statement option from one of the prescripted player statements, at each step in the simulation.

Decompensations of the statokinetic function of the spine caused by sedentary life, as well as the latter's late diagnosis, trigger in time the installation of various pathologies as it is indicated in the specialized literature. Consequences at a personal, social and economic level are huge and quite alarming.

As a consequence, the closer the positioning of the evaluation and the corrective intervention is to the causal chain basis, the better consequences of this action are and the prevention scope undergoes an exponential rise.

The technology-mediated learning model (Guichon) combines two types of thinking patterns, that of the means provided by technologies, and the one of didactic objectives, and it permits to build the training direction by taking into account the psychosocial factors. Our aim in this study is to present a technology-mediated learning model meant to develop the intercultural competences of the future engineers, but equally their discursive and textual competences. Several premises underlie our endeavour; firstly, the fact that the language is an assembly of procedures that express and transmit meanings, secondly, these meanings are built and decoded by the interlocutors according to the cultural grids specific to the collectivity, thirdly, a public having developed technical knowledge permits a better valorization of the psychoaffective aspects of education, and, finally, the current instrumentation for the acquisition of the language that essentially represents an instrument of transaction among individuals allows them to act as social actors.

Therefore, it is frequently that they resort to automatic translation. This paper will approach a new issue, that has little been studied so far, namely finding out the relationship between gender and text type, and automatic translation, respectively. Within a context where the text has a permanent dynamic, where we deal beside the « classical» texts that can be localized in time and space from the statement viewpoint, with texts close in terms of form, even if they are semantically so very open and up to hypertexts in which the form participates in the construction of the meaning, the criteria of textuality established by text linguistics should be revisited. Thus, there are two types of questions which appear : firstly, what approach should we have to the act of translation, how is it reported to the text and what types of translation operations are mobilized; secondly, how do the genre and type of text to be translated influence the translation. Based on the automatic translation of a text corpus belonging to various genres, this paper will study the conditions of appropriacy of the act of translation carried out by means of software in function of the text genericity.

802,76013,"Technology-pedagogy Relationship in Developing e-Learning Systems for Chemical Engineering Education","technology pedagogy relationship develop e learn system chemical engineering education",en,"Higher education in chemical engineering offers many opportunities and challenges for elearning.  Some issues dealing with technology-pedagogy relationship in approaching the development of an e-learning system in the specific frame of technical higher education are explored in this paper.  Although advanced technology provides opportunities for developing quality e-learning content, this will not necessarily lead to good content delivery, if technology is not matched with an appropriate set of pedagogical concepts.  On the other hand pedagogical methods need be adapted to the new conditions of the today lifestyle, based more and more on information and communication technology.  The instructors should have in mind that the today under-30 generation has grown up with fast-paced computer games, movies, television programs, and a lot of other interactive multimedia content.  Reading a text simply doesn’t fit to their living philosophy. The relationship between the developer and instructor plays a very important role in developing feasible educational content for integrated e-learning systems.  The skills of a good teacher should be focused on providing the best available procedure for guiding the targeted learner to the next stage of understanding a specific learning task.  Yet much e-learning content is not designed by instructors and often they are not part of the development team.  On the other hand, a lot of good instructors have a lack of understanding the unique teaching advantages offered by the information and communications technology. The communication issue is also important in developing an e-learning system, both from the technological point of view, as well as from the pedagogical point of view.  There is a very solid reason for introducing the word communication in the collocation “information and communication technology”.  The possibilities of local or non-local (even world-wide) collaboration raise the issue of how to build positive collective intelligence.The results obtained during the last four years, since developing an e-learning system became a constant preoccupation, in terms of students’ grades and skills acquired justify the recommendation of using e-learning technology as support for modern pedagogy.","high education chemical engineering offer many opportunity challenge e learn issue deal technology pedagogy relationship approach development e learn system specific frame technical high education be explore paper advanced technology provide opportunity develop quality e learn content not necessarily lead good content delivery technology be not match appropriate set pedagogical concept other hand pedagogical method need be adapt new condition today lifestyle base more more information communication technology instructor have mind today generation have grow up fast pace computer game movie television program lot other interactive multimedia content read text simply doesn t fit living philosophy relationship developer instructor play very important role develop feasible educational content integrated e learn system skill good teacher be focus provide best available procedure guide targeted learner next stage understand specific learning task yet much e learn content be not design instructor often be not part development team other hand lot good instructor have lack understand unique teaching advantage offer information communication technology communication issue be also important develop e learning system technological point view as well pedagogical point view be very solid reason introduce word communication collocation information communication technology possibility local non local even world wide collaboration raise issue build positive collective intelligence result obtain last year develop e learn system become constant preoccupation term student grade skill acquire justify recommendation use e learn technology support modern pedagogy",en,4,proceedings-article,,NULL,,,NULL,NULL,NULL,"technology,content,communication technology,system,technology pedagogy relationship,instructor,education,communication,constant preoccupation in term of student grade,technology as support for modern pedagogy,lot of other interactive multimedia content,feasible educational content for integrated e,pedagogy,preoccupation in term,system for chemical engineering education,high education in chemical engineering,good content delivery if technology,appropriate set of pedagogical concept,frame of technical high education,computer game movie television program,high education,technological point of view,pedagogical point of view,paper although advanced technology,lot of good instructor,other hand pedagogical method,interactive multimedia,chemical,multimedia,preoccupation,engineering,issue,information,skill,term,challenge for e,today under generation,point of view,e learning system,doesn t fit,specific learning task,unique teaching advantage,world wide collaboration,best available procedure,positive collective intelligence,preoccupation in term of student,learning,point,quality e,computer game,multimedia content,living philosophy,development team,communication issue,word communication,collocation information,many opportunity,specific frame,other hand,new condition,important role,integrated e,good teacher,targeted learner,next stage,much e,solid reason,constant preoccupation,computer,game,student,hand,lot,view,education in chemical,other interactive multimedia,delivery,movie,constant preoccupation in term,content for integrated e,content delivery,educational content,opportunity,relationship,development,concept,method,today,mind,television,text,developer,part,lack,possibility,result,year,grade,recommendation,system for chemical,computer game movie,interactive multimedia content",en

Besides physical parameters, such as humidity, falling index, deformation index, and wet gluten, generally used to assess the bakery value, the heavy metals content should be also known for food safety reasons. Lead, cadmium, and copper were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy with graphite furnace atomization and ion chromatography with postcolumn derivatization and results were compared in terms of sample preparation, linearity, and associated uncertainty. Providing comparable results, ion chromatography based on uv-vis detection may become an alternative method for heavy metal quantification in several solid and liquid food matrices.Three types of flour were evaluated in the current study and the physical parameters signalled good panification values. Humidity varied between 14 and 15.6 %, all falling index values were above 250 s, while the wet gluten exceeded 23 % in all cases. The heavy metals contents of maximum 8.7 ppb Cd2+, 0.2 ppm Pb2+ and 3.1 ppm Cu2+ were recorded; all bellow the officially admitted concentrations, so the samples evaluated are considered safe from the security point of view.","bread bakery product be basic product human alimentation main ingredient product production wheat flour fulfil quality requirement enter panification production line physical parameter such humidity fall index deformation index wet gluten generally use assess bakery value heavy metal content be also know food safety reason lead cadmium copper be analyze atomic absorption spectroscopy graphite furnace atomization ion chromatography post column derivatization result be compare term sample preparation linearity associated uncertainty provide comparable result ion chromatography base uv detection become alternative method heavy metal quantification several solid liquid food matrix type flour be evaluate current study physical parameter signal good panification value humidity vary fall index value be s wet gluten exceed case heavy metal content maximum ppb cd2 ppm pb2 ppm cu2 be record officially admitted concentration sample evaluate be consider safe security point view",en,4,proceedings-article,,NULL,"knowledge testing,evaluation,grid tests","knowledge test evaluation grid test",en,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

In addition, the persistent nature, toxicity and accumulation of heavy metal ions in the human body have become the driving force for searching new and more efficient water treatment technologies to reduce the concentration of heavy metal in waters. Because the conventional techniques will not be able to keep up with the growing demand for lower heavy metals levels in drinking water and wastewaters, it is becoming increasingly challenging to implement technologically advanced alternative water treatments. Nanotechnology offers a number of advantages compared to other methods. Nanomaterials are more efficient in terms of cost and volume, and many process mechanisms are better and faster at nanoscale. Although nanomaterials have already proved themselves in water technology, there are specific challenges related to their stability, toxicity and recovery, which led to innovations to counteract them.

Our plugin enables users to specify basic filtering criteria, including their field of expertise, topics of interest from a predefined taxonomy, or expected themes (e.g., background knowledge, practice & counselling, or guidelines) for a preliminary pre-screening of lessons. In addition, learners can also provide a description in natural language of their learning interests. This text is compared with each lesson’s description using Cohesion Network Analysis, and lessons are selected above an experimentally set threshold.

Nevertheless, multi-participant conversation logs are often hard to follow by teachers due to the mixture of multiple and many times concurrent discussion threads, with different interaction patterns between participants. Automated guidance can be provided with the help of Natural Language Processing techniques that target the identification of topic mixtures and of semantic links between utterances in order to adequately observe the debate and continuation of ideas. This paper introduces a method for discovering such semantic links embedded within chat conversations using string kernels, word embeddings, and neural networks. Our approach was validated on two datasets and obtained state-of-the-art results on both. Trained on a relatively small set of conversations, our models relying on string kernels are very effective for detecting such semantic links with a matching accuracy larger than 50% and represent a better alternative to complex deep neural networks, frequently employed in various Natural Language Processing tasks where large datasets are available.","computer support collaborative learning tool be exhibit increase popularity education allow multiple participant easily communicate share knowledge solve problem collaboratively seek advice nevertheless multi participant conversation log be often hard follow teacher due mixture multiple many time concurrent discussion thread different interaction pattern participant automate guidance be provide help natural language processing technique target identification topic mixture semantic link utterance order adequately observe debate continuation idea paper introduce method discover such semantic link embed chat conversation use string kernel word embeddings neural network approach be validate datasets obtained state art result train relatively small set conversation model rely string kernel be very effective detect such semantic link match accuracy large represent well alternative complex deep neural network frequently employ various natural language processing task large datasets be available",en,6,journal-article,10.3390/math9243330,000735557200001,"Natural Language Processing; educational technology; neural networks; CSCL conversations; string kernels","natural language process educational technology neural network cscl conversation string kernel",en,"Mihai, Masala; Stefan, Ruseti; Traian, Rebedea; Mihai, Dascalu; Gabriel, Gutu-Robu; Stefan, Trausan-Matu",NULL,NULL,NULL

69156,171934,"De-Identification of Student Writing in Technologically Mediated Educational Settings",NULL,en,"When conducting research with data from smart learning systems, there is a need to protect user identities because the release of personally identifiable information (PII) poses a significant risk to participants and creates a barrier to analyzing data and/or creating open datasets. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are a good example of learning systems where PII concerns may hamper data analysis, the well-being of users, and system innovation. PII is particularly hard to locate and clean because of the variations in formatting, texts, and assignments found in unstructured data. In particular, identifying and removing students’ names has proven difficult. This study examines the potential to use large, pre-trained language models to de-identify MOOC data and compares performance on these language models to human annotations. On a validation set, a pre-trained language model fine-tuned using spaCy default hyperparameters achieved 97% recall of student names in the validation set, including partial matches, and 30% precision. On a larger, unseen test set (n = 3,077), the model achieved 93% recall and 24% precision. The majority of the false positives leading to lower recall in the test set were known names belonging to authors and/or lecturers. The results of the ensemble approach used here show considerable promise for a difficult de-identification task and indicate that automated de-identification is, likely, mature enough for use on some education datasets. Clearing PII from smart learning systems would ethically protect learners within the systems, allowing for the release of large datasets that could be analyzed for intelligent insights to forward innovation within smart learning systems.",NULL,en,6,book-chapter,10.1007/978-981-19-5240-1_12,,"De-identification,Personally identifiable information,Natural language processing",NULL,en,"Langdon, Holmes; Scott, Crossley; Nick, Hayes; Dylan, Kuehl; Anne, Trumbore; Gabriel, Gutu-Robu",NULL,NULL,NULL

The obtained nanoparticles were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry. The results demonstrated a successful coating of iron oxide nanoparticles with large molar weight dextran, of which agglomeration tendency depended on the amount of dextran in the coating solution.
